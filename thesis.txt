Abstract

Determining the chromatic number of the partition graph P(33 ) poses a considerable
challenge. We can bound it to 4 ≤ χ(P(33 )) ≤ 6, with exhaustive search confirming
χ(P(33 )) = 6. A potential athematical proof strategy for this equality involves identi-
fying a Z2 -invariant S 4 with(︁ non-trivial  homology in the box complex of the partition
graph P(3 ), namely Bedge P(3 ) , and applying the Borsuk-Ulam theorem to com-

     This thesis offers a thorough examination of various topological lower bounds for
a graph’s chromatic number, complete with proofs and examples. We demonstrate
instances where these lower bounds converge to a single value and others where they
diverge significantly from a graph’s actual chromatic number.
     We also classify all vertex pairs, triples, and quadruples of P(33 ) into unique
                                                                                 (︁ sub-

graphs. This classification informs the construction of all simplices of Bedge P(33 ) .

Following a detailed and technical exploration, we uncover both the maximal size of
the pairwise intersections of its maximal simplices and their underlying structure.
     Our study proposes an algorithm for building the box complex of the partition
graph P(33 ), using our method of identifying maximal complete bipartite subgraphs.
This reduces time complexity to O(n3 ), marking a substantial enhancement over
brute-force techniques.
     Lastly, we apply discrete Morse theory to construct a simplicial complex homo-
topy equivalent to the box complex of P(33 ), using two methods: elementary collapses
and the determination of a discrete Morse function on the box complex. This pro-
cess reduces the dimension of the box complex from 35 to 12, streamlining future
calculations of the Z2 -index and the Lovász bound.

      “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited,
     whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving
     birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research.”

     Graph theory, a central branch of discrete mathematics, is an indispensable tool
to model and resolve complex problems from diverse fields such as engineering and
computer science [17]. A pivotal concept within this discipline is the chromatic num-
ber of a graph. Defined as the minimum number of colours required to colour the
vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same colour. It
gives rise to intriguing theoretical questions, for example, the renowned Four Colour
Theorem [18].
     In addition to its theoretical relevance, the concept of the chromatic number has
practical implications. These extend to addressing real-world problems like exam or
task scheduling [19], frequency assignment in telecommunication systems [21], and
register allocation in compiler optimization [22]. However, calculating the chromatic
number of an arbitrary graph is an NP-complete problem [20]. This complexity
underscores the need for efficient algorithms and heuristics. Therefore, our thesis
embarks on a unique path of employing topological methods to resolve a chromatic
number question in graph theory.
     The synergistic interplay between topology and graph theory opens avenues for
innovative problem-solving. Examples of this collaboration are ‘Topological Graph
Theory’ and ‘Network Topology’ [23]. The former focuses on embedding graphs in
surfaces and studies the properties of graphs invariant under topological transforma-
tions, like the Four Colour Theorem [18]. The latter, applied in computer science
and network engineering, considers the layout of network elements (nodes and links),
drawing from graph theory and topology.
     In this thesis, we probe into the interaction between topology and graph theory
in a unique context which is from [3]. We build a simplicial complex from a given

Several topological lower bounds for the chromatic number of a graph G have been
proposed, including those by Sarkaria, Dol’nikov-Kříž, Bárány, and Lovász himself.
In 2003, Matoušek and Ziegler introduced a hierarchical arrangement of these lower
                           (︁ )︁ theorem. In this thesis, we use this theorem to obtain
bounds, known as the Hierarchy
a lower bound for χ(KG [n]   k
                                ), and a supplementary lemma to establish an upper
bound that matches the lower bound, thus proving 0.0.1 with a distinct methodology
from that of Lovász. This also illustrates that there are instances where all the lower
bounds in the hierarchy theorem can converge to a single value.
      Furthermore, our study illustrates that these lower bounds can significantly di-
verge from the actual chromatic number of a graph. This is demonstrated by calcu-
lating the Lovász bound for a graph devoid of a 4-cycle. Additionally, we calculate
the Lovász bound for odd cycles and bipartite graphs, illustrating scenarios where
this lower bound matches the actual chromatic number of the graph.
      The Lovász bound is the strongest of the lower bounds in the hierarchy theorem,
and involves the Z2 -index of a particular type of simplicial complex called box complex
of a graph G denoted by Bedge (G). Simplices of Bedge (G) are subsets of edge sets of
complete bipartite subgraphs of G, where the edges are oriented from the left side
to the right side. These complexes are essential in the theorem because the Z2 -index
can only be applied to Z2 -spaces, and box complexes are suitable Z2 -spaces.
      In this thesis, we conduct a comprehensive study of the partition graph P(33 ),
which is a special type of the general partition graph P(g g ) for g = 3. Every vertex
of a partition graph P(g g ) is a partition of {1, 2, ..., g 2 } into g cells of size g. Two
vertices u and v are adjacent if the intersection of each cell of u with each cell of v is
nonempty.
      We can bracket the chromatic number of P(33 ) within the bounds 4 ≤ χ(P(33 )) ≤
6. Through exhaustive search, it has been shown that χ(P(33 )) = 6. Given that the
Lovász bound serves as the strongest among the topological lower bounds provided by
the hierarchy theorem, one feasible strategy to establish χ(P(33 )) = 6 is to demon-
strate that the Lovász bound equals 6. This can be approached by identifying a
Z2 -invariant S 4 with non-trivial homology in the box complex Bedge (P(33 )) and ap-
plying the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. Although we have been unable to identify such an
S 4 in the box complex using current methods, we show that certain portions of the
box complex preclude the existence of any Z2 -invariant S 4 with non-trivial homology.
INTRODUCTION                                                                          xiv


      In this thesis, we successfully applied the proposed approach to the Petersen
graph. By calculating the box complex of the Petersen graph and simplifying it to
a homotopy equivalent simplicial complex, we computed its Z2 -index. This compu-
tation yielded a Lovász bound of 3, matching the chromatic number of the Petersen
graph.
      Our primary goal is to construct Bedge (G), the box complex of P(33 ). To accom-
plish this, it is necessary to identify the complete bipartite subgraphs within the graph
P(33 ). As a prerequisite, we undertake a comprehensive study of the general prop-
erties of P(33 ), noting that this graph exhibits vertex-transitivity, edge-transitivity,
and arc-transitivity. This understanding proves highly beneficial in facilitating further
analyses of this graph.
      Additionally, we categorized all vertex pairs, triples, and quadruples of the P(33 )
graph into distinct equivalence classes. We also derive all maximal complete bipartite
subgraphs of P(33 ) solely from pairs of vertices. By leveraging our categorization
of vertex pairs, triples, and quadruples, as well as incorporating new lemmas, we
demonstrate that the bipartite subgraphs obtained from the vertex pairs are in fact
the only maximal bipartite subgraphs of the graph. This approach allows us to
categorize all the maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ) into equivalence
classes, providing valuable insights into the structure of the graph.
      Given that each simplex of the box complex Bedge (P(33 )) represents an edge
subset of a complete bipartite subgraph of P(33 ), with the edges ordered from left
to right, we utilize the classification of all maximal complete bipartite subgraphs to
identify all the maximal simplices of Bedge (P(33 )) and their antipodes. Following
this, we delve into the structure of pairwise intersections of the simplices within
Bedge (P(33 )). Through this investigation, we uncover the maximal size of the pairwise
intersections of the simplices.
      A brute force algorithm to construct the box complex of a general graph would
be of time complexity of roughly O(n4 · 4n ). Thus, it is computationally expensive for
large graphs and may not scale well to practical use cases. In this thesis, we propose
an algorithm that constructs the box complex of the partition graph P(33 ). By
utilizing the approach to identifying the maximal complete bipartite subgraphs within
the graph P(33 ), our program significantly reduces the time complexity to O(n3 ).
This represents a substantial improvement over a brute-force approach, resulting in
improved processing speed.
      In order to make the box complex of P(33 ) more analyzable, we resort to dis-
crete Morse theory. The original Morse theory, formulated by Marston Morse in the
1920s and 1930s, offers a powerful mechanism for examining the topology of smooth
manifolds by scrutinizing the critical points of real-valued functions on these spaces.
This approach has significantly shaped various mathematical disciplines, including
algebraic topology, differential geometry, and mathematical physics. The core ideas
of Morse theory were later expanded into a discrete context by Robin Forman in
INTRODUCTION                                                                        xv


the late 1990s, sparking the inception of discrete Morse theory. This theory adapts
Morse theory concepts for use in discrete contexts such as cell complexes, offering an
efficient, elegant way to explore the topology of these complexes.
      In discrete Morse theory, the continuous functions applied in the original Morse
theory are replaced by assigning a numerical value to each cell of the complex, thus
turning all processes discrete. This reformulation illustrates the potential for de-
veloping a robust theory within combinatorial spaces that echoes the intricacies of
smooth theory, without necessitating continuity. Discrete Morse theory has found
successful applications across various fields of applied mathematics and computer sci-
ence, including topological data analysis [12, 13], geometry [10], denoising [16], mesh
compression [15] image processing and computer graphics [14, 11].
      Using this theory, we construct a simplicial complex homotopy equivalent to the
box complex of P(33 ) in two ways: by using the elementary collapses, and by finding
a discrete Morse function on the box complex. This dimension reduction reduces the
dimension of the box complex from 35 to 12, which simplifies the future calculation
of the Z2 -index and thus the Lovász bound. Additionally, the reduction yields a more
tractable object for further analysis.

     The study of combinatorial topology offers a rich interplay between various math-
ematical domains such as algebra, topology, and combinatorics. The box complex
which is a type of simplicial complex derived from a graph, is one of the tools that
embodies this interplay.
     The content presented in this chapter primarily follows the research and findings
articulated in the paper referenced as [3]. Our goal in this chapter is to interpret,
elaborate, and present these sophisticated concepts in a comprehensible manner to
the reader. We also state and prove some of our results.
     In the initial section, we revisit several key mathematical concepts including the
Knaser graph, simplicial complexes, along with Z2 -spaces and Z2 -index. These con-
cepts are foundational and integral to understanding box complexes, and the explo-
rations that we will undertake in subsequent sections are rooted in these fundamental
ideas.
     Moving forward, the concept of neighbourhood complexes is introduced and ex-
plored, as presented in the source paper. This discussion serves as a stepping stone
towards the understanding of box complexes. Different types of box complexes are
introduced, all of which are based on the definitions and examples provided in the
source paper. The relationships among these complexes are also explored, elucidating
the rich interconnectedness inherent within them.
     A crucial element of this chapter, and indeed in the paper [3], is the Hierarchy
Theorem. This theorem is a significant result that correlates the box complexes of

this theorem is provided, along with comprehensive proofs of lower bounds on the
chromatic number, including the Lovász, Dol’nikov-Kříž, and Bárány Bounds, all of
which are derived from the original paper.
     In this concluding section of the chapter, we will shift our focus onto the dis-
tinctive properties of the box complex when applied to specific types of graphs. We
will concentrate our examination on even and odd cycles, as well as bipartite graphs.
This analysis provides insight into the way certain graphical structures manifest in
the properties of their corresponding box complexes.

Kneser graphs
Let X be a finite set and F ⊆ 2X a system of subsets of X. The Kneser graph KG(F)
has vertex set F, and the edges are all pairs of disjoint sets in F. For convenience,
we assume that X = [n] := 1, 2, ..., n, unless stated otherwise.
     A proper k-colouring of a graph is a labelling of the graph’s vertices with k
colours such that no two vertices sharing the same edge have the same colour. The
smallest number of colours needed to colour a graph G is called its chromatic number
and is often denoted χ(G). A graph that can be assigned a (proper) k-colouring is
k-colourable.
                                 (︁ )︁ by Lovász in 1978, states that the
     Kneser conjecture, first proved                                           (︁[n]chromatic
number of a Kneser graph KG [n]        is              for             where            denotes
                                                                                     )︁

the family of all k−element subsets of [n]. Here we prove a weaker statement than
the Kneser conjecture.

Proposition 1.1.1. The chromatic number of a Kneser graph KG [n]             is less than or
                                                                       (︁ )︁
                                                                         k
equal to n − 2k + 2 or equally, this amount is an upper bound for chromatic number
and in fact, it is a proper colouring.
                                      (︃ )︃
                                        [n]
                              χ(KG            ) ≤ n − 2k + 2.
                                          k

Proof:      Let ci be all the subsets of [n] which contain i as their smallest number.
Consider the sets c1 , c2 , ..., cn−2k+1 , then, assign one colour to each ci . Since the sets
included in each ci are not disjoint, the corresponding vertices are not adjacent. So far
we have used n − 2k + 1 colours. All remaining sets are subsets of {n − 2k + 2, · · · , n}
which is of cardinality 2k − 1. So, none of these sets are disjoint. Hence, we can
assign one colour to all these sets.

      It is easy to see that every finite graph G = (V, E) can be represented as a
Kneser(︁ graph  of some set system. A simple and natural representation is this: Let
Ē := 2 \E denote the set of non-edges of G, and for every v ∈ V , set Fv := {ē ∈
         V
           )︁

Ē : v ∈ ē}. The Kneser graph of {Fv : v ∈ V } is isomorphic to G; the only problem
is that the sets Fv need not be all distinct (For example, for G = Kn , we have Fv = ∅
for all v). To remedy this, one can define Fv′ := Fv ∪ {v}, obtaining distinct sets.
      Example. Consider the graph G as the following, we see how it can be repre-
sented as a Kneser graph.

Geometric simplicial complexes
In geometry, points v0 , v1 , ..., vk are affinely

                                                             in Rd if      are real numbers
α0 , α1 , ..., αk , not all of them 0, such that i=0 αi vi = 0 and i=0 αi = 0. Otherwise,
                                                   k                  k
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                        4


v0 , v1 , ..., vk are called affinely independent. A set of points in a Euclidean space
is defined to be convex if it contains the line segments connecting each pair of its
points. The convex hull of a given set X is defined as the intersection of all convex
sets containing X and we denote it by conv(X).
      A simplex σ is the convex hull of a finite affinely independent set A in Rd . The
points of A are called the vertices of σ. The dimension of σ is dim(σ) = |A| − 1. Thus
every k-simplex (k-dimensional simplex) has k + 1 vertices. This concept generalizes
the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. The convex hull of
an arbitrary subset of vertices of a simplex σ is a face of σ. Thus every face is itself
a simplex. A nonempty family Σ of simplices is a simplicial complex if the following
two conditions hold:

  1. Each face of any simplex σ ∈ Σ is also a simplex of Σ.

  2. The intersection σ1 ∩ σ2 of any two simplices σ1 , σ2 ∈ Σ is a face of both σ1
     and σ2 .

The dimension of a simplicial complex is the largest dimension of a simplex: dim
Σ := max{dim σ : σ ∈ Σ}. We consider only finite simplicial complexes. The vertex
set of Σ, denoted by V (Σ), is the union of the vertex sets of all simplices of Σ.
Abstract simplicial complexes. Let V be a set, an abstract simplicial complex K is
a hereditary set system K ⊆ 2V of subsets of V ; that is, we require that F ∈ K
and G ⊆ F implies G ∈ K (in particular, ∅ ∈ K whenever K ̸= ∅). The sets in K
are its simplices. The vertex set of K is defined as V (K) = ∪K, the union of all
simplices of K. The elements of the vertex set are called the vertices of the complex.
Similar to the geometric version the dimension of a simplex S in K is defined as
dim(S) = |S| − 1: simplicies consisting of a single element are zero-dimensional,
simplices consisting of two elements are one-dimensional, etc. The dimension of the
complex K is defined as the maximum dimension of any of its simplices, or infinity
if there is no finite bound on the dimension of the simplices. A subcomplex of K
is an abstract simplicial complex L such that every face of L belongs to K; that is,
L ⊆ K. A face of a simplex S is a non-empty subset S ′ ⊆ S. We call f : K → L a
simplicial map if f (S) ∈ L for all S ∈ K. Two abstract simplicial complexes K and
L are isomorphic if there is a bijective simplicial map f : V (K) → V (L) such that
S ∈ K if and only if f (S) ∈ L.
     Given a geometric simplicial complex Σ, we can construct an abstract simplicial
complex K by throwing away all simplicies and retaining only their sets of vertices;
this is called the vertex scheme of Σ. In this case, we say Σ is a geometric realization
of K and also of any abstract simplicial complex isomorphic to K, and we write
Σ =∥ K ∥. Note that a geometric simplicial complex has a topology as a subset of Rd
and it can be shown that all geometric realizations of an abstract simplicial complex
K are homeomorphic as topological spaces. Although there is not a unique geometric
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                                    5


simplicial complex ∥ K ∥ associated to K, there is therefore a unique topological
space ∥ K ∥ that has the structure of a geometric simplicial complex and whose
vertex scheme is isomorphic to K. Properly speaking this is the meaning of ∥ · ∥ .
Constructing geometric realizations is feasible if the dimension of the ambient space
is sufficiently high.
     The following theorem ensures each abstract simplicial complex has a geometric
realization.
Theorem 1.1.2. [4, Theorem 1.6.1] Every finite d-dimensional simplicial complex K
has a geometric realization in R2d+1 .
     However, most of the time the geometric realization can be embedded in a lesser
dimensional space. The geometric realization of K can be convex or not, while,
the geometric realization of a simplex is always convex. Sometimes we just write
"simplicial complex" when referring to an abstract or geometric simplicial complex
when the usage is clear from the context.
     For a partially ordered set (X, ⪯), the order complex ∆(X, ⪯) has X as the vertex
set and all chains as simplices; that is, a simplex has the form {x1 , x2 , ..., xk } ⊆ X with
x1 ≺ x2 ≺ ... ≺ xk . In particular, if F is a set system, we write ∆F for ∆(F\{∅}, ⊆).
If K is a simplicial complex, then ∆K is the first barycentric subdivision of K, also
denoted by sd K (The empty simplex ∅ is not a vertex of the barycentric subdivision).
     The (twofold) deleted join of the simplicial complex K, denoted by K∆              ∗2
                                                                                           , has
vertex set V (K) × [2] (two copies of V (K)) and the simplices are

                             {S1 ⊎ S2 : S1 , S2 ∈ K, S1 ∩ S2 = ∅}

where we use the shorthand S1 ⊎ S2 := (S1 × {1}) ∪ (S2 × {2}).
Example 1.1.3. Take a simple triangle as an example of the simplicial complex K.
This triangle has 3 vertices, call them a, b, and c, and 3 edges, call them ab, bc, and
ac.
     The (twofold) deleted join of this triangle, K∆∗2
                                                       , will have a vertex set consisting
of two copies of the vertices a, b, and c, and we label them a′ , b′ , c′ , a′′ , b′′ , c′′ .
     Next, we need to construct the simplices. Remember that simplices in K∆                  ∗2
                                                                                                 are
formed by taking disjoint sets of simplices from the original complex, K, one from
each copy. For example, a valid 2-simplex would be formed by combining the vertex
a from copy 1 with the edge bc from copy 2, resulting in the 2-simplex {a′ , b′′ , c′′ }.
     Following this process, the 2-simplices are {a′ , b′′ , c′′ }, {b′ , a′′ , c′′ }. In the same
manner, we can continue to build 1-simplices (edges) for the complex K∆                ∗2
                                                                                          .
Definition 1.1.4. Let F be a set system with ground set X. Let K(F) be a simplicial
complex with vertex set X and

                         K(F) := {S ⊆ X : F ⊈ S for all F ∈ F}

    As an example consider the ground set X = {1, 2, 3} and F = {{1}, {1, 2}}, then
K = {{2}, {3}, {2, 3}}.

Z2 -space and Z2 -index
A Z2 -space is a pair (T, ν), where T is a topological space and ν : T → T , called the
Z2 -action, is a homeomorphism such that ν 2 = ν ◦ ν = idT . Two elements t ∈ T and
ν(t) ∈ T are called antipodal. If (T1 , ν1 ) and (T2 , ν2 ) are Z2 -spaces, a Z2 -map between
them is a continuous mapping f : T1 → T2 such that f ◦ ν1 = ν2 ◦ f . The sphere S n
is considered as a Z2 -space with the antipodal mapping x ↦→ −x. The Z2 - index of a
Z2 -space (T, ν) is
   ind(T, ν) := min{n ≥ 0 : there is a Z2 -map (T, ν) → S n } ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...} ∪ {∞}
(The Z2 -action ν is omitted from the notation if it is clear from the context).
For example, in the Borsuk-Ulam section, we see ind S n = n.
Proposition 1.1.5. If ind(T1 , ν1 ) > ind(T2 , ν2 ), then there is no Z2 -map T1 → T2 .
In other words, if there exists a Z2 -map T1 → T2 , then ind(T1 , ν1 ) ≤ ind(T2 , ν2 ).
Proof:       Suppose there is a Z2 -map h : T1 → T2 , then we have the following
diagram,
                                                     h
                                        T1               T2
                                       ν1                    ν2

                                                     h
                                        T1               T2
the equation ν2 ◦ h = h ◦ ν1 holds for this diagram. Let p : S n → S n be the continuous
antipodal map p(x) = −x. Assume ind(T1 , ν1 ) = m, ind(T2 , ν2 ) = n, and m > n. So,
there exists Z2 -map g : T2 → S n and we have the following diagram,
                                                     g
                                        T2               Sn
                                       ν2                    p
                                                     g
                                        T2               Sn
Since ind(T1 , ν1 ) = m, there is no Z2 -map f : T1 → S n such that the equation
f ◦ ν1 = p ◦ f holds. Using the two diagrams we can make the following diagram,
                                            h            g
                                  T1             T2               Sn
                                 ν1             ν2                 p

                                            h            g
                                  T1             T2               Sn
So the equation p ◦ (g ◦ h) = (g ◦ h) ◦ ν1 holds which means g ◦ h : T1 → S n is a
Z2 -map, this is a contradiction.

Borsuk-Ulam Theorem
The Borsuk-Ulam theorem is a foundational result in the field of algebraic topology.
In its most common form, for a sphere in n-dimensional Euclidean space, the Borsuk-
Ulam theorem states that for any continuous function f from the n-sphere to n-
dimensional Euclidean space, there exists a pair of antipodal points. These are points
that are diametrically opposite to each other on the sphere and are mapped to the
same point by the function f . One of the intriguing interpretations of this theorem
is that at any given time, there are two antipodal places on earth with identical
temperature and air pressure.
     There are various equivalent versions of this theorem, some of which are crucial
for this research. While proving any of the versions of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem is
far from trivial and requires some technical apparatus, checking the equivalence of
all these statements is significantly less daunting. For a comprehensive proof of this
theorem and additional versions, refer to [4].

Theorem 1.1.6. [4, Theorem 2.1.1] For every n ≥ 0, the following statements are
equivalent and true:

  1. For every continuous mapping f : S n → Rn , there exists a point x ∈ S n with
     f (x) = f (−x), (This is the most common interpretation).

  2. For every antipodal mapping f : S n → Rn (that is, f is continuous and f (−x) =
     −f (x) for all x ∈ S n ) there exists a point x ∈ S n satisfying f (x) = 0.

  3. There is no antipodal mapping f : S n → S n−1 .

  4. There is no continuous mapping f : B n → S n−1 that is antipodal on the bound-
     ary, i.e., satisfies f (−x) = −f (x) for all x ∈ S n−1 = ∂B n .

Proof:     (1) → (2) : Since there exists the point x ∈ S n such that f (x) = f (−x)
and f is an antipodal mapping, then,

                               f (x) = f (−x) = −f (x)

So, f (x) = 0.
     (2) → (1) : Suppose f : S n → Rn is a continuous mapping. Define function
g : S n → Rn as g(x) := f (x) − f (−x). Then,

                g(−x) = f (−x) − f (x) = −(f (x) − f (−x)) = −g(x)

Hence, function g is a continuous antipodal mapping. So, there exists a point x ∈ S n
such that g(x) = 0 and f (x) = f (−x).

     (2) → (3) : An antipodal mapping S n → S n−1 ⊆ Rn is a nowhere zero antipodal
mapping S n → Rn (because 0 is not antipodal to any other point in Rn and is not
included in S n−1 ).
     (3) → (2) : Assume that f : S n → Rn is a continuous nowhere zero antipodal
mapping. Then, the antipodal mapping g : S n → S n−1 given by g(x) = f (x)/∥f (x)∥
contradicts. (3) → (4) : We can easily prove it by observing that the projection
π : (x1 , . . . , xn+1 ) ↦→ (x1 , . . . , xn ) is a homeomorphism between the upper hemisphere
U of S n and the closed ball B n .
     Let g : B n → S n−1 be a mapping as in (4). We can define a mapping f : S n → S n
by setting f (x) = g(π(x)) for x ∈ U , and f (−x) = −g(π(x)) for x ∈ U . This specifies
f on the whole of S n , it is consistent because g is antipodal on the equator of S n , and
the resulting f is continuous since it is continuous on both of the closed hemispheres.
     (4) → (3) : Let f : S n → S n−1 be an antipodal mapping as in (3). Then, we can
define a mapping g : B n → S n−1 that is antipodal on ∂B n by g(x) = f (π −1 (x)) using
the function π introduced above.


    Considering the last equivalencies we can re-state the Borsuk-Ulam theorem as
ind(S n ) = n.

Simplicial Z2 -complexes
Definition 1.1.7. A simplicial Z2 -complex is a simplicial complex K with a simplicial
map ν of K into itself such that ν is a Z2 -action on K.

    For the deleted join K∆ ∗2
                               , we have the Z2 -action by "swapping the two copies of
V (K)", formally (v, 1) ↦→ (v, 2) and (v, 2) ↦→ (v, 1).

Proposition 1.1.8. Suppose K is a simlicial Z2 -complex whose Z2 -action is not free
(that is, has a fixed point), then ind K = ∞.

Proof:     Suppose x is a fixed point of ν : K → K which means ν(x) = x and
f : K → S is a Z2 -map. So, we can form the following diagram,
         n


                                              f
                                        K         Sn
                                       ν            p
                                              f
                                        K         Sn

The diagram is commutative, p ◦ f = f ◦ ν. For the special fixed point x ∈ K we have
p(f (x)) = f (ν(x)) = f (x). So, f (x) is a fixed point for p, which is a contradiction
because p(x) = −x for all x ∈ S n . Hence, there is no such a number n for which
f : K → S n be a Z2 -map. We can conclude that ind K = ∞.

      The following theorem, originally stated in [3], establishes an upper bound for
Z2 -simplicial complexes. In this section, we provide a detailed proof to support this
theorem.

Proposition 1.1.9. [3] For any simplicial Z2 -complex K whose Z2 -action is free, we
have the following hierarchy,

                                    dim K ≥ ind K                                (1.1.1)

Proof:
     The goal is to construct a Z2 -map g : ∥K∥ → S n for a Z2 -simplicial complex K
with dim(K) = n. We will use induction on n to build this map.
     For the base case of our induction, we start with n = 0. In this scenario, ∥K∥
consists of 0-dimensional simplices, i.e., points. We can define a Z2 -map from ∥K∥
to S 0 (which is composed of two points) by pairing each point in ∥K∥ with a point
in S 0 , in a manner that respects the Z2 -action.
     For the induction step, assume that we have constructed a Z2 -map gk : ∥Kk ∥ →
S for all k < n. We denote by ∥Kk ∥ the k-skeleton of K, i.e., the subspace of
  k

K spanned by simplices of dimension at most k. We already have a Z2 -map gn−1 :
∥Kn−1 ∥ → S n−1 .
     The n-sphere S n can be thought of as being formed by gluing together two n-
balls (B n+ and B n− ) along their boundary, which is an (n − 1)-sphere S n−1 . Our goal
is to extend gn−1 to a Z2 -map gn : ∥K∥ → S n .
     We begin by letting gn coincide with gn−1 on ∥Kn−1 ∥. Now, consider an n-simplex
s in K, and its antipodal simplex s̃ under the Z2 -action. We extend the definition of
gn to the interiors of s and s̃ by mapping them to B n+ and B n− respectively. This
construction respects the Z2 -action because s and s̃ are mapped to opposite hemi-
spheres of S n .




1.2     Neighbourhood Complexes
For a graph G and any subset A ⊆ V (G), let

         CN(A) := {v ∈ V (G) : {a, v} ∈ E(G) for all a ∈ A} ⊆ V \ A              (1.2.1)

be the set of all common neighbours of A. By CN(∅) we mean all the vertices of G.
    For a graph G, we can build simplicial complexes. Two of them are introduced
below:
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                                 10


Definition 1.2.1. [3] The neighbourhood complex of a graph G is a simplicial complex
defined as
                        N (G) := {S ⊆ V (G) : CN(S) ̸= ∅}.
Therefore, the simplices of N (G) are the vertex subsets that have at least one common
neighbour.
     Refer back to the order complex definition, denoted by ∆, discussed in Section
1.1. We now present another simplicial complex, defined as the order complex of the
complete system of “closed sets” in N (G), as established in [3]:

                       L(G) := ∆{A ⊂ V (G) : CN(CN(A)) = A}.

Thus, the vertices of L(G) are sides of inclusion-maximal complete bipartite subgraphs
of G.

    Example. Suppose
                                        e             a



                                        f             b



                                        g             c


                                        h             d

                                   Figure 1.3: Graph G

    Then, one can specify write the simplices of N (G) and L(G).

    N (G) = {vertices: {a}, {b}, ..., {h},
             edges: {a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d}, {e, f }, {e, g}, {f, g},
             {g, h}
             triangles: {a, b, c}, {e, f, g}, {a, c, d}, {a, b, d}, {b, c, d}
             4-simplex: {a, b, c, d}}

It is obvious that every non-isolated vertex of G is a vertex of N (G).

                L(G) =∆{{a, b, c}, {e, f, g}, {d}, {g, h}, {a, b, c, d}, {g}}

We can think of the L(G) simplices as pairs. For example, the sets {a, b, c} and
{e, f, g} are pairs because CN{a, b, c} = {e, f, g} and CN{e, f, g} = {a, b, c}.

            Figure 1.4: Complex N (G) at left and complex L(G) at right

     After presenting the definition of the complexes N (G) and L(G) and discussing
their characteristics through a concrete example, we now further investigate the re-
lationship between these two complexes. We will elucidate the relationship between
their vertices and simplices, especially how their structures intertwine with each other.
     The following lemma establishes a fundamental connection between N (G) and
L(G): the correspondence between the maximal simplices of N (G) and the vertices
of L(G).

Lemma 1.2.2. Each maximal simplex of the complex N (G) is a vertex of the complex
L(G).

Proof:     Suppose S is a maximal simplex of N (G) and CN(S) = S ′ . The goal is to
prove CN(S ′ ) = S, then conclude S and S ′ are vertices of L(G).
    Since CN(S) = S ′ , each v ∈ S is adjacent to all the vertices of S ′ . So,
S ⊆ CN(S ′ ). Suppose v ∈ CN(S ′ ) and v ∈      / S. As S is a maximal simplex of
N (G) and CN(S) = S , it means there is a maximal complete bipartite subgraph of
                       ′

                                               / S then the subgraph S ∪ {v} and S ′
G with sides S and S ′ . If v ∈ CN(S ′ ) and v ∈
make a bigger complete bipartite subgraph than the bipartite subgraph with sides S
and S ′ which is a contradiction.


    The following lemma establishes a basic but essential property about the common
neighbours function.

Lemma 1.2.3. Given a graph G and two subsets S and T of V (G) such that S ⊆ T ,
it holds that CN(T ) ⊆ CN(S).

Proof:     Let v be an arbitrary vertex in CN(T ). By definition of CN(T ), the vertex
v is adjacent to every vertex in T . Since S is a subset of T , every vertex in S is also
a vertex in T , and hence, v is adjacent to every vertex in S. This shows that v is
in CN(S). As v was arbitrary, we have shown that every vertex in CN(T ) is also in
CN(S), which implies CN(T ) ⊆ CN(S).

Lemma 1.2.4. Given a graph G and a subset S of V (G), it is true that
                           (︁          )︁
                        CN CN(CN(S)) = CN(S).

Proof:    Since vertices of S are adjacent(︁to all the vertices of CN(S), then S ⊆
CN(CN(S)). By Lemma 1.2.3, we have CN CN(CN(S)) ⊆ CN(S).
                                                           )︁

    Now assume x ∈ CN(S).    Then )︁all the vertices of CN(CN(S)) are adjacent to x.
Consequently, s ∈ CN CN(CN(S)) . So,
                     (︁

                                          (︁            )︁
                           CN(S) ⊆ CN CN(CN(S)) .




     Propelled by the conclusions drawn from these lemmas, we are then able to prove
the following proposition. This proposition lays out a significant conclusion about the
intersection of maximal simplices of N (G). This intersection, under the application
of the CN function twice, remains invariant, resulting in being a vertex of L(G).

Proposition 1.2.5. The intersection of the maximal simplices of N (G) is a vertex
in L(G).

Proof:      Let S and T be two maximal simplices of N (G). By lemma 1.2.2 we know
S and T are vertices of L(G), so, CN(CN(S)) = S and CN(CN(T )) = T . The goal
is to prove CN(CN(S ∩ T )) = S ∩ T . Suppose CN(S ∩ T ) = S ′ , it is obvious that
S ∩ T ⊆ CN(S ′ ). Assume v ∈ CN(S ′ ) but v ∈   / S ∩ T . Then v is just adjacent to all
the vertices of S . Without loss of generality, suppose v ∈
                 ′
                                                           / S. Since CN(CN(S)) = S,
then v ∈/ CN(CN(S)). By the last argument, one can say

              CN(S) ⊆ CN(S ∩ T ) ⇒ CN(CN(S ∩ T )) ⊆ CN(CN(S)).

                 / CN(CN(S)) but v ∈ CN(CN(S ∩ T )), there is a contraction. So,
As we supposed v ∈
CN(CN(S ∩ T )) = S ∩ T .

A retraction is a continuous mapping from a topological space into a subspace that
preserves the position of all points in that subspace. The subspace is then called a
retract of the original space. A deformation retraction is a mapping that captures
the idea of continuously shrinking a space into a subspace.

Definition 1.2.6. Let X be a topological space and A a subspace of X. Then a
continuous map r : X → A is a retraction if the restriction of r to A is the identity
map on A; that is, r(a) = a for all a in A.
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                       13


      A retraction in a discrete context gives us a way to “collapse” a larger structure
onto a smaller one while preserving the structure of the smaller object. The condition
r(a) = a for all a in A is what gives us the “retraction” concept - it’s saying that if
we start with a point in A, applying the function r doesn’t change it - it “retracts”
back onto itself.
      Given two continuous functions f and g from a topological space X to a topolog-
ical space Y , a homotopy between f and g is a continuous function H : X ×[0, 1] → Y
such that H(x, 0) = f (x) and H(x, 1) = g(x) for all x in X.
Definition 1.2.7. Let X and Y be topological spaces. A map f : X → Y is a
homotopy equivalence if there exists a map g : Y → X such that g ◦ f is homotopic
to the identity map idX and f ◦ g is homotopic to the identity map idY .
Definition 1.2.8. A continuous map F : X × [0, 1] → X is a deformation retraction
of a space X onto a space A, if for every x ∈ X and a ∈ A,

                      F (x, 0) = x,   F (x, 1) ∈ A,   F (a, 1) = a.

     In other words, a deformation retraction is a homotopy between a retraction and
the identity map on X. The subspace A is called a deformation retract of X.
     If, in the definition of a deformation retraction, we add the requirement that
F (a, t) = a for all a ∈ A, F is called a strong deformation retraction. The following
proposition originally was stated in [3]. While the statement can be found in the
referenced work, for the sake of completeness and context, we provide a detailed
proof here.
Proposition 1.2.9. L(G) is a strong deformation retract of N(G).
Proof:      Define a retraction r : N (G) → L(G) by mapping each element x in N (G)
to the set of common neighbours of x, denoted by CN(x).
     The aim is to show that r is well-defined, i.e., that for all x ∈ N (G), the image
r(x) indeed belongs to L(G). To see this, note that each member of N (G) is a subset
of the vertices of G which have at least one common neighbour. So, every subset
x ∈ N (G) lies within one side of a maximal bipartite subgraph of G, which we denote
as y. Now, since x ⊆ y, we have r(y) ⊆ r(x) by Lemma 1.2.3. However, r(y) is one
side of a maximal bipartite subgraph. So we actually have equality: r(x) = r(y).
Because of the same reason, CN(CN(r(y))) = r(y) and thus r(y) ∈ L(G). Therefore,
r(x) ∈ L(G).
     Consider any x ∈ L(G). By the definition of L(G), we have r2 (x) = x, indicating
that r2 : N (G) → L(G) is a retraction of N (G) onto L(G). Since r is a function
concerning the discrete structure of N (G) and L(G), there is no need to check the
continuity of r, we consider it a continuous function.
     Now consider the geometric realization of the simplicial complexes of N (G) and
L(G). We can exhibit a strong deformation retraction of ∥N (G)∥ onto ∥L(G)∥ using
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                         14


the homotopy f : ∥N (G)∥ × I → ∥N (G)∥, where I = [0, 1] and f (x, t) = (1 − t)x +
tr(x). This function is continuous because all the operations and the function r are
continuous. This function satisfies the properties of a strong deformation retract,
namely:


                f (x, 0) = x                             ∀x ∈ ∥N (G)∥
                f (x, 1) ∈ ∥L(G)∥                        ∀x ∈ ∥N (G)∥
                f (a, t) = a                       ∀a ∈ ∥L(G)∥, ∀t ∈ I
Hence, f provides a strong deformation retraction of ∥N (G)∥ onto ∥L(G)∥.




1.3     Box Complexes
In the definition that follows, we present six different variations of box complexes.
Four of these variations are defined with respect to the Kneser graph of a set F, while
the remaining two are directly defined for the set F. As a reminder, the Kneser graph
of a graph G, denoted KG(G), was introduced earlier in Section 1.1.
Definition 1.3.1. (Box complexes). Let G = (V, E) = KG(F) be a finite graph
with no isolated vertices, and suppose that the ground set of F is [n]. The first two
complexes are on the vertex set V × [2].
  1. The box complex B(G) is
                   B(G) :={A′ ⊎ A′′ : A′ , A′′ ⊆ V, A′ ∩ A′′ = ∅,
                          G[A′ , A′′ ] is complete, CN(A′ ), CN(A′′ ) ̸= ∅}.
      The simplices of B(G) correspond to complete bipartite subgraphs in G. We
      admit A′ or A′′ empty, but it is required that all vertices of the other side have
      a common neighbour.
      A canonical simplicial Z2 -action on B(G) is given by interchanging the two
      copies of V (G); that is, (v, 1) ↦→ (v, 2) and (v, 2) ↦→ (v, 1), for v ∈ V (G). This
      makes B(G) into a Z2 -space.
  2. A simpler definition, but a larger complex, is obtained as
                       B0 (G) :={A′ ⊎ A′′ : A′ , A′′ ⊆ V (G),
                                A′ ∩ A′′ = ∅, G[A′ , A′′ ] is complete}
      This box complex contains B(G), here if one side is empty, the other can be
      anything.

  3. The following definition of a box complex takes into account only the complete
     bipartite graphs with both sides nonempty:

                                                  ̸ A′ , A′′ ⊂ V,
                      Bchain (G) :=∆{A′ ⊎ A′′ : ∅ =
                                   A′ ∩ A′′ = ∅, G[A′ , A′′ ] is complete}

     Here the vertices are the vertex set of complete bipartite subgraphs of G, and
     the simplices are chains of such sets under inclusion. Also Bchain (G) is included
     in ∆ B(G). A set of vertices can serve as the vertex set of different complete
     bipartite subgraphs, leading to different vertices and simplicies.

  4. The vertices of the next box complex are the directed edges of G; that is, ordered
     pairs (u, v) with {u, v} ∈ E.
                                    −
                                    →
                       Bedge (G) :={ F ⊂ A′ × A′′ : ∅ ≠ A′ , A′′ ⊂ V,
                                   A′ ∩ A′′ = ∅, G[A′ , A′′ ] is complete}

     Simplices of this box complex are subsets of edge sets of complete bipartite
     subgraphs of G, where the edges are oriented from the first side to the second
     side.

  5. The simplicial complex ∆((2[n] )∗2  ∆ \ K∆ ) will appear in theorem 1.4.1, as an
                                                 ∗2

     intermediate step in Sarkaria’s derivation of his lower bound. Now, we delve
                  ∆ \ K∆ ) more. Recall definition 1.1.4about the simplicial complex
     into ((2[n] )∗2     ∗2

     K. Then, K∆     ∗2
                        is all the B ′ ⊎ B ′′ such that B ′ , B ′′ ⊆ [n], B ′ ∩ B ′′ = ∅, and
     F ⊈ B ′ , B ′′ for all F ∈ F. So, ∆((2[n] )∗2∆ \ K∆ ) can be expressed as
                                                       ∗2


                                   ′     ′′   ′    ′′           ′     ′′
                  BKG
                   Sark (F) :=∆{B ⊎ B : B , B ⊆ [n], B ∩ B = ∅
                              at least one of B ′ , B ′′ contains a set of F}.

     The vertex sets are pairs of disjoint subsets of the ground set of F that sup-
     port a complete bipartite subgraph of the Kneser graph, with at least one side
     nonempty.

  6. Finally, another Kneser box complex is
                                     ′       ′′    ′  ′′         ′    ′′
                    BKG
                     chain (F) :=∆{B ⊎ B : B , B ⊆ [n], B ∩ B = ∅
                                 both B ′ , B ′′ contain a set of F}.

     On each of these types of box complexes, we have the natural Z2 -action that
interchanges the sides of the bipartite subgraph.
Example 1.3.2. Let the graph G be the 5-cycle, G = C5 . In this example, we
provided different box complexes for the graph C5 with their geometrical object.

                                   Figure 1.5: A C5 graph




                                       Figure 1.6: B(C5 )


 1. The simplicial complex of B(C5 ):
   In this example, B(C5 ) does not contain any tetrahedrons or the simplices of
   the form {1′ , 2′ , 3′ , 4′ , 5′ } or {1′′ , 2′′ , 3′′ , 4′′ , 5′′ }, in other words left and right-hand
   sides are removed.
   To have a better understanding of the simplices of the box complex B(C5 ) we
   take a closer look at the recent Figure 1.6. To write down the vertices we just
   need to pick a vertex from C5 and do the ⊎ operation with empty set, also, the
   order matters because each pair (a C5 vertex and empty set) makes a vertex at
   the left-hand side and another one at the right-hand side, the difference is just
   the order of the pair (for example ∅ ⊎ {1} and {1} ⊎ ∅ are two vertices at right
   and left-hand side respectively).
   The edges of B(C5 ) are of two kinds, the middle ones and the ones at the sides.
   To make the side edges we need to take two vertices of C5 like v1 and v2 for
   which CN(v1 , v2 ) ̸= ∅ , then do ⊎ with empty set. Again, order matters because
   changing the order of a pair gives us another edge at the other side (like {1, 3}⊎∅
   is an edge at the left-hand side and ∅ ⊎ {1, 3} is an edge at the right-hand side).
   On the other hand, the middle edges are ordered pairs of the vertices v1 and
   v2 for which CN(v1 ), CN(v2 ) ̸= ∅ and G[{v1 }, {v2 }] is complete (in this case,
   since there is just one vertex in our set, having a common neighbour is equal to
   having a neighbour). But this time we do the ⊎ operation between the vertices
   and do not use empty set (for example {1} ⊎ {2} and {2} ⊎ {1} are two middle
   edges).
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                                    17


    For the 2−simplices or triangles we need to choose 3 vertices of C5 like {v1 , v2 }
    and {v3 } with the property CN({v1 , v2 }), CN({v3 }) ̸= ∅ and G[{v1 , v2 }, {v3 }]
    is complete, then do the ⊎ operation for two sets with considering the pair as
    an ordered pair ({1, 3} ⊎ {2} and {2} ⊎ {1, 3} are two triangles).
    To declare the vertices on the left side are different from the vertices on the
    right side we distinguish them with ′ and ′′ in the figures. But for pointing out
    to them when talking about the simplices of the box complexes we do not use
    ′
      and ′′ . For a simplex like X ⊎ Y , the set X shows the left side vertices or the
    ones with ’ and the set Y shows the right side vertices or the ones with ”.

 2. The simplicial complex of B0 (C5 ):

                               1'                               5''




                          3'                                          3''




                                5'                              1''


                                     Figure 1.7: B0 (C5 )


    If we notice we see that the two left and right sides of B0 (G) are complete
    graphs. This box complex is a union of B(C5 ) and some other simplices. The
    new simplices are the ones which make the sides complete. The reason for this
    difference is that in B0 (C5 ) the constraint CN(A′ ), CN(A′′ ) ̸= ∅ does not exist,
    therefore B0 (C5 ) has more simplices than B(C5 ) (for example two of the new
    simplices are {1, 5} ⊎ ∅ and ∅ ⊎ {1, 5}).

 3. The simplicial complex of Bchain (C5 ) :
    The box complex Bchain (C5 ) is the barycentric subdivision of just the middle
    simplices of B(C5 ), i.e., the simplicies of the form {i′ } ⊎ {j ′′ , t′′ }, {j ′ , t′ } ⊎ {i′′ },
    or {i′ } ⊎ {j ′′ } and the reason is the sets A′ and A′′ are non-empty based on the
    definition of this box complex.

 4. The simplicial complex of Bedge (C5 ) :
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                   18


                            1'                              5''


                                   4'               2''

                       3'                                         3''
                                   2'              4''


                            5'                              1''


                                 Figure 1.8: Bchain (C5 )




                                 Figure 1.9: Bedge (C5 )


   We can use the same set of sets we used for B0 (C5 ) because the constraints
   on the sets are the same but instead of doing ⊎, here we do × (for example,
   {(1, 2)} = {1} × {2} is a vertex and {(1, 2), (1, 5)} = {1} × {2, 5} is an edge).

 5. To give an example on BSark (F) and Bchain (F) we need to work on a set F.
    Consider the set F = {{1}, {1, 2}} and the ground set as [n] = {1, 2, 3}. The
    simplicial complex K(F) is (look at definition 1.1.4),

                            K = K(F) = {{2}, {3}, {2, 3}}

   So it is just two vertices and the edge between them.

                                        2          3


                                  Figure 1.10: K(F)

   Recalling the definition of deleted join,
                       ∗2
                      K∆  = {S1 ⊎ S2 : S1 , S2 ∈ K, S1 ∩ S2 = ∅}
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                  19


   for vertices we follow the same procedure as before, take one singleton and do
   the operation ⊎ with empty set, like {2} ⊎ ∅. For edges we take two different
   singletons and do the operation ⊎, like {2} ⊎ {3}. So K∆∗2
                                                              looks like

                                                      ∗2




   The set 2[3] consists of all subsets of {1, 2, 3}. So we can draw the simplicial
                  ∆ as
   complex (2[3] )∗2

                                  1'                       3''


                       2'                                          2''


                                  3'                        1''

   This simplicial complex contains the triangles in the figure 11 but does not
   contain any higher dimensional simplex. Then, by removing K∆   ∗2
                                                                     from (2[3] )∗2
                                                                                 ∆
   we get


                                  1'                        3''


                       2'                                           2''

      To find the box complex BKGSark we should look at its definition. This box complex
      is the order complex of a set, so first we need to find this set. Since {1} and
      {1, 2} are the only members of F we can have any combination using one of these
      sets or any other set in 2[3] which contains one of these two sets, with another
      set from 2[3] as long as their intersection is empty (for example {1} ⊎ {2} and
      {2} ⊎ {1, 3}). Then, one can try to draw the box complex BKG       Sark and get the
      same figure as the above for ∆((2 )∆ \ K∆ ) .
                                          [3] ∗2   ∗2

      In this case for our example the box complex BKG   chain (F) is empty. Notice that
      the box complexes BKGSark and B KG
                                      chain (F) are simplicial complexes but we take the
      order complex of a partially ordered set which is not always a simplicial complex
      because we are allowed to have a triangle without some edges or vertices.

     We will study the index of these simplicial complexes later on. For this purpose,
we need to know more about the index. Suppose K and K ′ are two Z2 -spaces and
ind K ′ = n, also, f : K → K ′ is a simplicial Z2 -map. Hence, there exists the Z2 -map
ν1 : K ′ → S n . So, the map ν2 = ν1 ◦ f is a Z2 -map from K to S n . Therefore,
ind K ≤ n.
Lemma 1.3.3. Let K be a simplicial complex and (K, ν1 ) be a Z2 space. Then,
ind K = ind sd K.
Proof:      Since K is a Z2 -space, each vertex in K has an antipodal vertex, as well
as each simplex of K. Hence, the barycentric sd K is a Z2 -space, by sending each
new vertex that appears in sd K to its antipodal vertex in sd K. One can set the
inclusion f : K → sd K. It is obvious that f is a Z2 -map and simplicial. As a result,
ind K ≤ ind sd K.
     Now suppose ind K = n, so, there exists the Z2 -map g : K → S n . Since S n has a
continuous structure, as long as there exists a Z2 -map from K to S n , there exists a Z2 -
map from sd K to S n . Hence, ind sd K ≤ ind K. As a conclusion, ind sd K = ind K.


Here susp K denotes the suspension of a simplicial complex K (a "double cone" over
K) as
             susp K := K ∪ {S ∪ {s} : S ∈ K} ∪ {S ∪ {n} : S ∈ K}
where s and n are two new vertices not belonging to V (K).
    The following proposition provides explicit simplicial Z2 -maps among the various
box complexes.
Proposition 1.3.4. For any finite graph G = KG(F) without isolated vertices, there
are simplicial Z2 -maps

Proof:      Here is a scheme of the proof, more details can be found in the reference
[3].
     (M1): It is an inclusion.
     (M2): The map sd Bedge (G) → Bchain (G) is defined on the vertices of sd Bedge (G)
by setting F
           ⃗ → h(F ⃗ ) ⊎ t(F             ⃗ ) collects the tails and t(F
                            ⃗ ), where h(F                            ⃗ ) collects the heads,
of the directed edges in F  ⃗ . For the other direction, we take the edges between the
sides of each complete bipartite subgraph.
     (M3): It can be seen as an inclusion.
     (M4): The map is obtained by mapping the complete bipartite subgraphs (with
one side empty) to the suspension points.
     (M5): A Z2 -map BKG  chain (F) → Bchain (G) is defined on the vertices by

                B ′ ⊎ B ′′ → {F ′ ∈ F : F ′ ⊆ B ′ } ⊎ {F ′′ ∈ F : F ′′ ⊆ B ′′ }.

                        chain (F) is obtained by mapping the vertices:
A Z2 -map Bchain (G) → BKG

                                A′ ⊎ A′′ → (∪A′ ) ⊎ (∪A′′ ).

(M6): The same formulas define Z2 -maps B0 (G) ↔ BKG
                                                  Sark (F).
(M7): The vertices of sd sd B(G) are like

                          A = (A′0 ⊎ A′′0 ⊂ ... ⊂ ... ⊂ A′k ⊎ A′′k ).

Let µ′ (A) be the smallest nonempty set in the chain of sets A′ := (A′0 ⊂ ... ⊂ A′k ⊆
CN(A′′k ) ⊆ ... ⊆ CN(A′′0 ), and similarly for µ′′ (A′′ ). Then let the map be

                                    A → µ′ (A) ⊎ µ′′ (A).

(M8): Define a Z2 -map f : sd L(G) → Bchain (G) in a way that f (A) := A0 ⊎ CN(Ak ),
where a vertex of sd L(G) is a chain A = (A0 ⊂ A1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Ak ) of nonempty closed
sets.
      (M9): A vertex in sd Bchain (G) is a chain A = (A′0 ⊎ A′′0 ⊂ ... ⊂ ... ⊂ A′k ⊎ A′′k ) so
we get the chain CN2 (A′0 ) ⊆ ... ⊆ CN2 (A′k ) ⊆ CN(A′′k ) ⊆ ... ⊆ CN(A′′0 ). By omitting

the repeated sets from this chain, we obtain a vertex of sd L(G).


     Now we can use this proposition to prove the following theorem. In this theorem,
all the box complexes are divided into two groups based on their Z2 -index.

Theorem 1.3.5. The following holds for the Z2 -indices of the various box complexes:

          ind B(G) = ind BKG
                          chain (F) = ind Bedge (G) = ind Bchain (G) = ind L(G)
                    ≤ ind B0 (G) = ind BKG
                                        Sark (F) ≤ ind B(G) + 1.

Proof:       All the equalities and inequalities can be derived from the last proposition.
For the last inequality we intend to use (M 4) from the last proposition which is about
suspension, so we need to prove ind susp K ≤ ind K + 1 as well.
      Suppose ind K = n. Let f : K → S n be the Z2 -map. We make a new Z2 -map
g : susp K → susp S n . Suppose ν : K → K and p : S n → S n are Z2 -actions of K and
S n respectively. It is easy to extend them to the Z2 -maps ν ′ : susp K → susp K and
p′ : susp S n → susp S n by mapping the new vertices to each other. Then the Z2 -map
g would be identity on K and maps the new vertices of susp K to the new vertices
of susp S n in such a way that makes it a Z2 -map. Also, it can be seen easily that
susp S n = S n+1 . We can get the homeomorphism by dividing the vectors of susp S n
by their norms.




1.4       The Hierarchy Theorem
In the following theorem, we can find the comparison of all the considered lower
bounds for χ(G). This is the main theorem of Matoušek and Ziegler’s paper [3].

Theorem 1.4.1. (The Hierarchy Theorem). Let G = (V, E) = KG(F) be a
finite (Kneser) graph with no isolated vertices, where F ⊆ 2[n] , and let K = K(F) =
{S ⊂ [n] : F ⊈ S for all F ∈ F}. Then we have the following chain 1 of inequalities
and equalities:

       χ(G) ≥ ind B(G) + 2 = ind L(G) + 2                             The Lovász bound
            ≥ ind B0 (G) + 1 = ind ∆((2[n] )∗2  ∗2
                                            ∆ \K∆ ) + 1
            ≥ n − 1 − ind K∆∗2
                                                                      The Sarkaria bound
            ≥d     if K ⊆ ∂P for an (n − d) − polytope P              The Bárány bound

    This is a chain of inequalities and equalities except at the end, where there is not a relation
between the Bárány bound and the Dol’nikov-Kříž bound.

     Here is proof of this theorem.



1.4.1      The Lovász Bound
We need to get familiar with some new concepts before going to proof. A cross
polytope is a convex hull

                                   conv{e1 , −e1 , ..., en , −en }

of the vectors of the standard orthogonal basis and their negatives. Alternatively, it
is the unit ball of the l1 −norm: {x ∈ Rn :∥ x ∥≤ 1}.




 (a) n = 1                                (b) n = 2                                   (c) n = 3

     In reference [4] the boundary of an n-dimensional cross polytope is stated as
♢n−1
      which is a simplicial complex with a subset F ⊆ V (♢n−1 ) forming a simplex
whenever there is no i ∈ [n] such that both i ∈ F and −i ∈ F .
     In theorem 1.3.5 we saw the relation ind B(G) ≤ ind B0 (G). Here we state
something stronger for the complete graph Km . In reference, [3] it is stated that the
box complex B0 (Km ) is isomorphic to the boundary complex of an m−dimensional
cross polytope. So, the geometric realization of the simplicial complex B0 (Km ) is
homeomorphic to an S m−1 and thus ind B0 (Km ) = m − 1.
     Now, proving this statement. Suppose {1′ , 2′ , ..., m′ , 1′′ , 2′′ , ..., m′′ } are the vertices
of B0 (Km ). Since Km is a complete graph, every vertex on the left-hand side is
adjacent to all the vertices on the right-hand side except itself. Also, each pair of
the vertices in Km has a common neighbour, so, there is a copy of Km at each side.
Moreover, each vertex at ♢m−1 is adjacent to all other vertices except its pair. Hence,
the following isomorphism exists

                                      f : B0 (Km ) → ♢m−1
                                      f (i′ ) = i, f (i′′ ) = −i
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                       24


The function f and its inverse are obviously simplicial and bijective.
     From the definition of box complexes, we know B(G) ⊆ B0 (G). The box complex
B(Km ) is isomorphic to ♢m−1 with two opposite facets removed, with its antipodal
Z2 -action, because the only difference between B0 (Km ) and B(Km ) is that B0 (Km )
has two copies of Km on its two sides and B(Km ) does not have.
     Besides, every m−colouring of G can be regarded as a homomorphism of G into
Km so we can extend it to a homeomorphism of B(G) to B(Km ) in an obvious way,
it induces a Z2 -map of B(G) into S m−2 , and we obtain
                                χ(G) ≥ ind B(G) + 2.
Also, theorem 1.3.5 proved ind B(G) = ind L(G).
    Finding a lower bound for the chromatic number of the Petersen graph is a
non-trivial application of the Lovász bound.
Example 1.4.2. In this example, we consider the Petersen graph denoted by P and
depicted in Figure 1.16.




                          Figure 1.16: The Petersen graph

     Our aim is to investigate the edge box complex of this graph, Bedge (P ). Ac-
cording to the definition of the box complex, the simplices of this simplicial complex
correspond to the edge subsets of the complete bipartite subgraphs of the graph P .
The maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of P are K1,3 , which consist of a vertex
and its three neighbours. The intersection of two such subgraphs contains only one
edge. Consequently, in the box complex, the maximal simplices are triangles, and
their intersections are either empty or consist of a single vertex.
     We identify the two antipodal vertices (6, 9) and (9, 6) in the box complex
Bedge (P ). It can be verified that these vertices are connected through the edges
shown in Figure 1.17.



    Figure 1.17: The connecting edges of tho antipodal points (6, 9) and (9, 6) in
    the box complex of Petersen graph
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                         25


      This set of edges is homotopy-equivalent to a one-dimensional ball B 1 , and the
two endpoints of this path, the antipodal vertices (6, 9) and (9, 6), form a Z2 -invariant
S 0 . According to the fourth version of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (Theorem 1.1.6),
there does not exist a Z2 -map from B 1 with Z2 -invariant boundary to S 0 . Therefore,
there is no such map from the box complex Bedge (P ) to S 0 , implying that the Z2 -index
of Bedge (P ) is greater than zero.
      Given that the graph is not particularly large, we can compute the entire Bedge (P ).
To better understand Bedge (P ), we can perform some simplifications. We can identify
all vertices of each triangle, turning each triangle into a single vertex. Addition-
ally, to represent the intersection of two triangles, we create an edge between the
corresponding points, as shown in Figure 1.18.




             Figure 1.18: An example of the identifications on Bedge (P )

     The resulting Bedge (P ) after these simplifications is depicted in Figure 1.19, with
antipodals of black vertices shown in red.




              Figure 1.19: The edge box complex of the Petersen graph

    We can further simplify this figure by identifying pairs of vertices, as shown in
Figure 1.20.
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                        26




    Figure 1.20: A simplified version of the edge box complex of Petersen graph

      Both Figure 1.19 and Figure 1.20 are homotopy equivalent to Bedge (P ). It is
evident that there is a Z2 -map from this box complex to S 1 . We can embed Figure
1.20 into R2 such that the origin is at its center, and antipodal points lie on a single
line passing through the origin. Then, we can define a Z2 -map as follows: consider
all lines passing through the origin in each quadrant of the plane. For each point
on these lines, map it to the corresponding point on S 1 lying in the same quadrant.
Since the action of Z2 on S 1 corresponds to a reflection through the origin, this is a
Z2 -map.
      In conclusion, the Z2 -index of Bedge (P ) is equal to one, and the Lovász bound is
equal to three. The inequality in the Hierarchy Theorem 1.4.1 verifies that χ(P ) ≥ 3.
In this example, the inequality holds as equality since the chromatic number of the
Petersen graph is known to be three.
     The Sarkaria bound. Since the proof is long we do not go into it here but
refer the interested reader to chapter 5.7 of the reference [4].

1.4.2    The Dol’nikov-Kříž Bound
From the proposition 1.1.9 it can be seen easily that
                                      ∗2                ∗2
                         n − 1 − ind K∆  ≥ n − 1 − dim K∆  .
For a set system F, let the 2-colourability defect cd2 (F) be the minimum size of a
subset Y ⊆ X such that the system of the sets of F that contain no points of Y is
2−colourable. In other words, we want to colour each point of X red, blue, or white
in such a way that no set of F be completely red or completely blue but it can be
completely white, and cd2 (F) is the minimum number of white pints required for
such a colouring.
     To see the proof of n − 1 − dim K∆
                                      ∗2
                                         = cd2 (F), suppose dim(K∆∗2
                                                                     ) = m. It means
dimension of the largest simplex S of K∆ is m, so, this simplex has m + 1 vertices.
                                         ∗2
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                         27


Let V1 and V2 be the vertices of two sides of K∆∗2
                                                   and vertices of the simplex S be the
subset S1 of V1 and S2 of V2 . By the definition of K there is no set of F included in
S1 or S2 . Hence, we can assign red to all vertices of S1 and blue to all vertices of S2 .
Then, we colour the rest of the n − (m + 1) vertices white, so, no set of F would be
completely red or completely blue so it is a proper colouring.
     Assume we colour an additional element x from X either in blue or red. Given
that S1 and S2 are maximal sets of K, adding one extra element to them would result
in a set from F. If we choose to colour x blue, then the set S2 ∪ {x} would be entirely
blue, thus creating an all-blue set from F. Similarly, if we decide to colour x red, we
would yield an all-red set from F, specifically S1 ∪ {x}.

1.4.3     The Bárány Bound
We need to prove that if the simplicial complex K is a part of the boundary of an
k−dimensional convex polytope P , then ind(K∆     ∗2
                                                     ) ≤ k − 1. Before going into the
details we need to get familiar with some new concepts and their properties.
      If X and Y are topological spaces, the join X ∗ Y is the quotient of the product
space X × Y × [0, 1] by the equivalence ≈, where (x, y, 0) ≈ (x′ , y, 0) and (x, y, 1) ≈
(x, y ′ , 1) for all x, x′ ∈ X and y, y ′ ∈ Y .




                                      t=0       t=1
                 X      Y             X     Y   [0,1]          X*Y


    The following proposition and its proof from Matoušek’s book [4] gives us a
geometric understanding of join.
Proposition 1.4.3. (Geometric join). Suppose that X and Y are subspaces of some
Euclidian space, and that X ⊆ U and Y ⊆ V , where U and V are skew affine
subspaces of some Rn (That is, U ∩ V = ∅ and the affine hull of U ∪ V has dimension
dim U + dim V + 1). Moreover, suppose that X and Y are bounded. Then the space
                 Z ′ := {tx + (1 − t)y : t ∈ [0, 1], x ∈ X, y ∈ Y } ⊂ Rn
i.e., the union of all segments connecting a point of X to a point of Y , is homeomorphic
to the join X ∗ Y .
Proof:     There is an obvious continuous map
                                f : X × Y × [0, 1] → Z ′
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                         28


                                  (x, y, t) → tx + (1 − t)y.
We want to form X ∗ Y on the left-hand side. The map f descends to the quotient
space because it takes the same value on the points which are identified. This gives
us a continuous map as follows
                                g : (X × Y × [0, 1])/ ≈→ Z ′ .
In fact, g is a homeomorphism because it is bijection, continuous, and its inverse is
continuous too.

When K is a simplicial complex, K ∗2 := {S ′ ⊎ S ′′ : S ′ , S ′′ ∈ K}. If we look at the
last picture as simplices, we get the same result but from a simplicial point of view.
The explicit members of join X ∗ Y are as follows
                                                        1'       1''
                           1'
                                            1''


                                                   2'            2''
                                      2''
                           2'

                            X         Y                 X*Y



   X ∗ Y ={{1} ⊎ {1}, {1} ⊎ {2}, {2} ⊎ {1}, {2} ⊎ {2}, {1} ⊎ {1, 2}, {2} ⊎ {1, 2},
          {1, 2} ⊎ {1}, {1, 2} ⊎ {2}, {1, 2} ⊎ {1, 2}}
Also X∆
      ∗2
         is as follows
                                 ∗2
                                X∆  = {{1} ⊎ {2}, {2} ⊎ {1}}
and it looks like

                                              1'        1''




                                     2'                 2''


     It is convenient to write a point in the join X ∗Y , which is formally an equivalence
class [(x, y, t)] as the "formal convex combination" tx ⊕ (1 − t)y.
     Given two maps f : X1 → X2 and g : Y1 → Y2 , join of the maps is
                         f ∗ g : X 1 ∗ Y1 → X2 ∗ Y2
                         tx ⊕ (1 − t)y → tf (x) ⊕ (1 − t)g(y).
Now with the following steps and with the help of proposition 1.4.3 we can prove the
claim ∥ K ∥∗2 ≃∥ K ∗2 ∥.

 1. Let U and V be skew affine subspaces in Rd , and let A ⊂ U and B ⊂ V be
    affinely independent sets. Then, A ∪ B is affinely independent.
   Suppose A ∪ B                                         ∑︁ some nonzero coefficients
                ∑︁ is affinely dependent. So, there exists
   αi such that    αi xi = 0 for all xi ∈ A ∪ B and           αi = 0. Now separate xi in
   A and B                 ∑︂           ∑︂           ∑︂
                               α i xi =    αi′ x′i +    αi′′ x′′i = 0
   where x′i ∈ A and x′′i ∈ B. It means members of B are combinations of the
   members of A and vice versa. Hence,
                ∑︂            ∑︂                     ∑︂
                    αi′ x′i ,    αi′′ x′′i ∈ U ∪ V ⇒    αi xi ∈ U ∪ V.

   On the other hand, U ∩ V = ∅. So, the only possibility is that all xi be in A
                                                                  ∑︁ A is affinely
   or B. Without loss of generality, suppose xi ∈ A for all xi . But
   independent  so we have  a contradiction   because we  assumed   αi xi = 0 and
      αi = 0. As a result, A ∪ B is affinely independent.
   ∑︁

 2. The union of all segments connecting a point of conv(A) to a point of conv(B)
    is the simplex conv(A ∪ B).
   The goal is to prove conv(conv(B) ∪ conv(A)) = conv(A ∪ B). Since A ∪ B ⊆
   conv(A) ∪ conv(B), it is obvious that

                       conv(A ∪ B) ⊆ conv(conv(B) ∪ conv(A)).

   For the other direction, we have

                  conv(A) ⊆ conv(A ∪ B) , conv(B) ⊆ conv(A ∪ B)
                   ⇒ conv(A) ∪ conv(B) ⊆ conv(A ∪ B).

   Since conv(conv(A ∪ B)) = conv(A ∪ B), we have

                       conv(conv(A) ∪ conv(B)) ⊆ conv(A ∪ B).

 3. Now we can use proposition 1.4.3 to prove that ∥ K ∥ ∗ ∥ L ∥≃∥ K ∗ L ∥ for
    any two finite simplicial complexes K and L.
   Let ∥ K ∥⊆ R2k+1 and ∥ L ∥⊆ R2l+1 so we can take the subspaces U ⊆ R2k+2l+2
   and V ⊆ R2k+2l+2 such that,

                          ∥ K ∥⊆ U,     ∥ L ∥⊆ V,    U ∩V =∅

   and the polytopes ∥ K ∥ and ∥ L ∥ be embeded in R2k+2l+2 such that they are
   affinely independent. By the first step, ∥ K ∥ ∪ ∥ L ∥ is affinely independent,
   so dim(conv(∥ K ∥ ∪ ∥ L ∥)) = dim(K) + dim(L) + 1.
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                       30


      Now by the proposition, ∥ K ∥ ∗ ∥ L ∥ is homeomorphic to the union of all
      segments connecting a point of ∥ K ∥ to a point of ∥ L ∥. Take an arbitrary
      simplex of K as S1 and an arbitrary simplex of L as S2 . We know simplices are
      convex hulls of their vertices, by the second step above we conclude all segments
      from S1 to S2 form the simplex conv(S1 ∪ S2 ) which is exactly the definition
      of S1 ⊎ S2 . Also, we know all the simplices of K ∗ L are of the form S1 ⊎ S2 ,
      so there is a one-to-one relation between the simplices of both sides. Thus, if
      we take the identity map on the vertices, we get a simplicial and bijective map
      which is continuous from topological point of view.
As we said earlier K is a part of k−dimensional convex polytope P . The rest is from
reference [3]. Using the homeomorphism ∥ K ∗2 ∥→∥ K ∥∗2 and a homeomorphism
of the boundary of P with S k−1 , we obtain a Z2 -map h :∥ K ∗2 ∥→ S k−1 ∗ S k−1 .
Moreover, if we restrict the left-hand side to ∥ K∆
                                                  ∗2
                                                     ∥ we remove the simplices of K ∗2
which have the same vertices, then the image contains no point of the form (x, x, t)
and it is of the form
                     (S k−1 ∗ S k−1 )\{(x, x, t) : x ∈ S k−1 , t ∈ [0, 1]}
but we rather work with the following set because it has the same index and it is
more useful
                                                  1
                     Z := (S k−1 ∗ S k−1 )\{(x, x, ) : x ∈ S k−1 }.
                                                  2
This space is equipped with the Z2 -action (x, y, t) → (x, y, 1 − t). This set certainly
includes the previous one. So h is a Z2 -map ∥ K∆   ∗2
                                                       ∥→ Z. It suffices to show that
ind(Z) ≤ k − 1. Let S  k−1
                            be represented as the unite sphere in Rk . One can define
the Z2 -map g : Z → S k−1
                           by
                                               tx − (1 − t)y
                             g(x, y, t) :=                     .
                                             ∥ tx − (1 − t)y ∥
If tx − (1 − t)y = 0 for unit vectors x, y, then t = 21 and x = y. Also, this map gets
the same value on the identified parts of the left side. Thus, the map is well defined,
and obviously continuous because before modding out the quotient space this map
was S k−1 × S k−1 × [0, 1] → S k−1 which is a continuous map. Clearly, g commutes
with the respective Z2 -actions. This concludes the proof.


1.5     Properties of the Box Complex in Special Graph
        Types
As previously(︁ discussed in Subsection 1.1, we introduced a special type of Kneser
graph as KG k . By applying the concept of the 2-colourability defect, cd2 , intro-
               [n]
                   )︁

duced in the Dol’nikov-Kříž Bound, and leveraging the results from Proposition 1.1.1,
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                       31


we can investigate the Z2 -index of the Kneser graph KG [n]      . This will be detailed
                                                           (︁ )︁
                                                             k
in the following proposition.

Proposition 1.5.1. Let G be the Kneser graph KG [n]       . Then ind(B(G)) = n − 2k
                                                    (︁ )︁
                                                      k
and χ(G) = n − 2k + 2.

Proof:       Let F ⊆ 2[n] represent the set of vertices of the graph G. Each vertex
corresponds to a k-subset of the n-set [n]. Recall 2-colourability defect from section
1.4.2. Our goal is to compute the 2-colourability defect, cd2 (F).
     Consider a colouring scheme where we colour k − 1 elements of [n] in red and
another k−1 elements in blue. The remaining elements of [n], amounting to n−2k+2,
are left uncoloured (or white). In this scenario, no set of F will be entirely red or
entirely blue.
     However, if we were to colour k elements in either red or blue, we would inevitably
create a subset of size k that is monochromatic, which contradicts our objective. Thus,
k − 1 is the maximum number of elements that we can colour in one colour, either
red or blue.
     From this, we deduce that cd2 (F) = n − 2k + 2. According to the Hierarchy
Theorem, the following inequality holds:

                          χ(G) ≥ ind(B(G)) + 2 ≥ cd2 (F).

Furthermore, from Proposition 1.1.1, we have already established that χ(G) ≤ n −
2k + 2. Therefore

                      n − 2k + 2 ≤ χ(G) ≤ n − 2k + 2 and
                      n − 2k + 2 ≤ ind(B(G)) + 2 ≤ n − 2k + 2

which implies χ(G) = n − 2k + 2 and ind(B(G)) = n − 2k.

In [3], the authors presented a statement about the relationship between the absence
of a 4-cycle in a graph and its Z2 -index. Although the paper did not provide details
of the proof for this statement, we will elaborate on the proof here to elucidate the
result concerning the Z2 -index of graphs without a 4-cycle. For an alternative proof
of this proposition, please refer to [7].

Proposition 1.5.2. [3] If the graph G does not include any 4-cycle C4 , then ind(B(G)) ≤
1.

Proof:     To demonstrate the proposition, we aim to find a Z2 -map from B(G) to
S . We construct this map in two steps. Firstly, we define a function f from sd B(G)
  1

to a 1-dimensional subcomplex of B(G). Secondly, we create a function from this
1-dimensional sub-complex to S 1 .
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                           32


     The map f is applied on the vertices of sd B(G), which are the simplices of B(G).
It’s defined as follows:
                                        ⎧
                                                   ′
                                        ⎨∅ ⊎ CN(A )
                                        ⎪              |A′ | ≥ 2
                         f (A′ ⊎ A′′ ) = CN(A′′ ) ⊎ ∅  |A′′ | ≥ 2               (1.5.1)
                                        ⎪
                                        ⎩ ′    ′′
                                          A ⊎A         o.w
     In this function, f maps each simplex to a 1-dimensional or 0-dimensional sim-
plex depending on its size. The intuition behind this function is to prepare for the
subsequent mapping to S 1 .
     Consider a simplex A′ ⊎ A′′ in B(G). Then, (A′ , A′′ ) forms a complete bipartite
subgraph of G with A′ on the left and A′′ on the right. If both |A′ | and |A′′ | are greater
than or equal to 2, a cycle of length 4 would exist in this subgraph, contradicting our
assumptions. Thus, at least one of |A′ | and |A′′ | must be less than 2.
     This argument ensures that if |A′ | ≥ 2 (or equivalently |A′′ | ≥ 2), the number
of common neighbours of A′ (or A′′ respectively) doesn’t exceed 1. As a result, the
image of sd B(G) under the function f contains no simplex larger than 1-dimensional.
     Also, f (sd B(G)) is a Z2 -space, mapping ∅ ⊎ CN(A′ ) to CN(A′ ) ⊎ ∅ and swapping
A′ ⊎ A′′ and A′′ ⊎ A′ , confirming that f is a Z2 -map.
     Next, we define a Z2 -map g from f (sd B(G)) to S 1 embedded in R2 , as follows:
                                      ⎧
                                      ⎨(1, 0)
                                      ⎪                    A′ = ∅
                        g(A′ ⊎ A′′ ) = (−1, 0)             A′′ = ∅
                                      ⎪
                                        (0, 1) or (0, −1) o.w
                                      ⎩

     Note that if g(A′ ⊎A′′ ) = (0, 1) then g(A′′ ⊎A′ ) = (0, −1). This definition ensures
that g maps the 1-dimensional subcomplex of f (sd B(G)) to S 1 and is a Z2 -map.
     The composite function g ◦ f is hence a Z2 -map from sd B(G) to S 1 , implying
that ind sd B(G) ≤ 1. Therefore, by Lemma 1.3.3 (which states that the index of a
simplicial complex is equal to the index of its barycentric subdivision), we conclude
that ind B(G) ≤ 1.

This proposition demonstrates that there are instances where the lower bounds out-
lined in the hierarchy theorem 1.4.1 can significantly deviate from the actual chromatic
number of a graph. Since odd cycles do not include any 4-cycle, it can be concluded
when G is an odd cycle we have ind(B(G)) ≤ 1. The following proposition further
refines our understanding of the ind(B(G)) for odd cycles.
Proposition 1.5.3. If G is an odd cycle, then ind(B(G)) = 1.
Proof:     Let G be an odd cycle with 2n + 1 vertices. The vertices of B(G) are of
the form {v} ⊎ ∅ and ∅ ⊎ {v} for each vertex v in V (G), yielding a total of 2(2n + 1)
vertices.
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                             33


   Observe that the following sets enumerate all possible subsets of V (G) sharing a
common neighbour.

              {1, 3}, {3, 5}, {5, 7}, ..., {2n + 1, 2}, {2, 4}, {4, 6}, ..., {2n, 1}   (1.5.2)
     Each of these sets shares a common neighbour, and by the definition of B(G) in
1.3.1, they can form the components A′ and A′′ in the simplices of the form A′ ⊎ ∅ and
∅ ⊎ A′′ . These simplices are edges and, due to the order of the elements and order of
the sets in (1.5.2), they form a cycle of 2n + 1 vertices. This is essentially a relabeling
of G, and these cycles form either side of the box complex B(G).
     Further, B(G) contains triangles of the form A′ ⊎ A′′ , where A′ or A′′ are as listed
in (1.5.3). The triangles are

                    {n, n + 2} × {n + 1} ,         {n + 1} × {n, n + 2}.               (1.5.3)
    These triangles interconnect, forming a hollow cylinder. The triangle {n, n+2}×
{n + 1} is attached to triangle {n} × {n − 1, n + 1} through the edge {n} × {n + 1}
and is attached to {n + 2} × {n + 1, n + 3} through the edge {n + 2} × {n + 1}.
Since they are of dimension 2 and connect the left and right-hand sides, B(G) is a
connected space. Figure 1.6 is an example of this box complex.
    Since G does not contain a 4-cycle, ind(B(G)) ≤ 1 (by Proposition 1.5.2). Also,
B(G) is connected, so there is no Z2 -map from this space to S 0 , thus ind(B(G)) = 1.



     It is true that the chromatic number of a bipartite graph G is 2 and by the
hierarchy theorem ind(B(G)) ≤ 0 (i.e. ind(B(G)) = 0). Now, we want to confirm the
index by finding the proper Z2 -maps.
Lemma 1.5.4. If G is a bipartite graph, then B(G), Bchain (G), and Bedge (G) each
admit a Z2 -map to S 0 .
Proof:         Let G = (A, B) be a bipartite graph, and let s = s′ ⊎ s′′ be a simplex in
B(G). By definition, G[s′ , s′′ ] must be complete. This imposes constraints on s′ and
s′′ .
        Suppose s′ , s′′ ̸= ∅. Firstly, if a, b ∈ s′ where a ∈ A and b ∈ B, then s′ ⊎ s′′
cannot be a simplex of B(G) because s′′ contains some elements from A or B or both
of them, and there is no edge between a and the other elements of A, and no edge
between b and other elements of B. So, G[s′ , s′′ ] cannot be complete. Secondly, if
s′ , s′′ ⊆ A or s′ , s′′ ⊆ B, s′ ⊎ s′′ is also not a simplex of B(G) for the same reason.
        If one of s′ or s′′ is empty, then complete G[s′ , s′′ ] happens when the non-empty
side has a common neighbour. Again since it is a bipartite graph, a set of vertices
from two sides cannot have a common neighbour and thus the nonempty side is a
subset of just one side.
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                        34


     This leaves only the case where s′ is a subset of A and s′′ is a subset of B (or
vice versa).
     Let K and L be subcomplexes of B(G) defined as follows: a simplex c = c′ ⊎ c′′
belongs to K if c′ ⊆ A and c′′ ⊆ B, and to L if c′ ⊆ B and c′′ ⊆ A. By the above
reasoning, every simplex of B(G) belongs to either K or L, and B(G) is the disjoint
union of K and L.
     We define a Z2 -action ν : B(G) → B(G) with ν(K) = L and ν(L) = K, and a
simplicial map f : B(G) → S 0 ⊂ R by

                              f (K) = 1 ,     f (L) = −1                          (1.5.4)

which is a Z2 -map since f ◦ ν = ν ◦ f .
     Observing that the conditions in the definition of B(G) are also satisfied for
Bchain (G) and Bedge (G), we find that Bchain (G) and Bedge (G) also decompose into two
sub-complexes. A similar function to f therefore provides a Z2 -map from Bchain (G)
and Bedge (G) to S 0 .


    If G is an even cycle or a tree, it is a bipartite graph, and by the above lemma,
ind(B(G)) = 0.
    This proof also presents the simplicial complex structure of the box complex
B(G) which is helpful to infer some structures of Bedge (G) and Bchain (G) as well.
This information is useful in the next proposition.

Proposition 1.5.5. Let G be a bipartite subgraph of P(33 ). Then the box complexes
B(G), Bedge (G), and Bchain (G) do not contain a S n for n ≥ 1 invariant to the Z2 -
action.

Proof:      Recall from the proof of the previous lemma, each of B(G), Bchain (G),
and Bedge (G) is expressed as a disjoint union of subcomplexes, denoted as K and
L. Moreover, these subcomplexes exhibit a Z2 -action ν such that ν(K) = L and
ν(L) = K.
    Suppose there exists an S n for some n ≥ 1 within the box complex. As S n is
connected, it must be fully contained in one of the disjoint components (either K or
L). However, this creates a contradiction. Since the box complex and the S n are
both supposed to be Z2 -equivariant, this would imply that all antipodal points on S n
would need to exist within the same component. This is impossible, as the Z2 -action
maps points from one component to the antipodal points in the other component.
Thus, an S n invariant to the Z2 -action cannot exist in the box complex.

Upon examining the definition of B0 (G), one observes that it requires G[A′ , A′′ ] to be
complete. However, the previous lemma and Proposition 1.5.5 do not hold for this
specific box complex. An illustrative example can be drawn from a simple bipartite
1. BOX COMPLEX                                                                   35


graph G consisting of two vertices, a, b, connected by a single edge. Then B0 (G) is
the simplicial complex in Figure 1.21.

     The box complex B0 (G) depicted above is a connected simplicial complex that
is homeomorphic to S 1 . Importantly, it cannot be mapped to S 0 via a Z2 -map.
     To demonstrate why, suppose a mapping function f exists. The only feasible
way for f to continuously map B0 (G) to S 0 would be to map all elements to a single
point in S 0 . However, such a function would fail to commute with the Z2 -actions
on the domain and target spaces, violating a fundamental requirement for a Z2 -map.
Therefore, no Z2 -map from B0 (G) to S 0 can exist.

Partition Graph

                                  make it happen.”

     In this chapter, we embark on an exploration of a unique family of graphs, termed
as partition graphs, symbolized as P(g g ). This investigation delves into the complexity
of these structures, beginning with simple elements and gradually escalating towards
more complicated constructs.
     Initially, we consider the partition graph P(22 ). Computing the chromatic num-
ber of this graph is a straightforward task. However, the complexity amplifies sig-
nificantly when we move on to the partition graph P(33 ). As the size of the graph
escalates exponentially, the task of finding the chromatic number becomes increas-
ingly challenging.
     Our approach to this challenge involves the utilization of the hierarchy theorem
(Theorem 1.4.1). This theorem provides a potential strategy to bound the chromatic
number of the graph G from below using topological tools. Among various lower
bounds in this theorem, the Lovász bound proves to be the most potent. This bound
is expressed in terms of the Z2 -index of the box complex of the graph G.
     We have previously established that almost all box complexes share a similar Z2 -

index (Theorem 1.3.5). In light of this, our research (︁primarily

ture compared to other box complexes. However, the computation and exploration
of the topological characteristics of this object are far from simple; they demand the
application of sophisticated topological methods. Some pertinent topological analyses
related to this complex will be provided in subsequent chapters of this work.

2.1      Definition and Properties
We now focus on the core subject of this chapter: partition graphs. These are the
intricate structures for which we aim to construct the box complex. We then further
deepening our understanding of the complex nature of partition graphs by studying
some of their general known properties.
     In this text, permutation and combination are denoted as:
                                        (︃ )︃
                   m         m!           m                 m!

                          (m − k)!        k             k!(m − k)!

Definition 2.1.1. Every vertex of a partition graph P(g g ) is a partition of {1, 2, ..., g 2 }
into g cells of size g. Two vertices u and v are adjacent if the intersection of each cell
of u with each cell of v is nonempty.

    The following proposition provides an upper bound for the chromatic number of
a partition graph:

Proposition 2.1.2. Let G = P(g g ) be a partition graph. Then
                                          (︃     )︃
                                    g       g+1
                            χ(P(g )) ≤
                                              2

Proof:       Fix a g + 1 set c ⊆ {1, 2, ..., g 2 }. For i, j ∈ c, (i ̸= j) let the set Sij consists
of all vertices which have i and j in one cell. Consider two arbitrary vertices u and v
in Sij . We shall call the cell with i and j in u and v respectively l and l′ . Obviously
2. PARTITION GRAPH                                                                            38


l ∩ l′ ̸= ∅. The cell l has g − 2 more elements except i and j, also there are g − 1
more cells in v except l′ . So, by the pigeon hole theorem there is a cell in v which
has empty intersection with l. Hence, u and v are not adjacent and as a result, Sij
is an independent set, i.e. there is no adjacent vertices in Sij . So, we can assign one
colour to each Sij .
      Now suppose x is an arbitrary vertex of P(g g ). Since x is a partition of {1, 2, ..., g 2 }
into g cells of size g, there must exist i, j ∈ c such that i, j are in one cell of x. It
means x ∈ Sij and the independent set Sij covers all the vertices of P(g g ), (For the
overlap elements(︁ of )︁some Sij we can consider the colour assigned to any of the Sij ).
      There are g+1 2
                          different Sij , if we assign one colour to each Sij , we have a
proper colouring for P(g g ). Since the chromatic number is the minimum of all proper
colourings, the inequality is true
                                                  (︃    )︃
                                             g      g+1
                                    χ(P(g )) ≤            .
                                                      2




Proposition 2.1.3. Let P(g g ) be any partition graph. For every vertex v of P(g g ),
there exists a corresponding vertex in a Kneser graph. This corresponding vertex
is characterized by a set which encompasses all pairwise elements of the cells of v.
Hence, every partition graph P(g g ) can be viewed as a Kneser graph.
Proof:      Assume v to be a vertex of the partition graph, so it contains g cells, each
of size g. The corresponding vertex in the Kneser graph, denoted as v ′ , is defined as
the set of all pairs chosen from the elements of each cell in v. As in standard Kneser
graphs, two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding sets are disjoint.
     Consider two vertices u and v in P(g g ) that are adjacent. This adjacency implies
that every cell in u intersects with each cell in v. Given the size of each cell is g and
there are g cells in the set of each vertex, there is precisely one element from each cell
of v present in each cell of u. Let’s denote the corresponding vertices in the Kneser
graph as u′ and v ′ . Every pair selected from any cell of u contains two elements from
two different cells of v. Thus, we cannot find any identical elements in u′ and v ′ .
Consequently, u′ and v ′ are disjoint and therefore adjacent in the Kneser graph.
     Now consider u′ and v ′ as two arbitrary adjacent vertices of the Kneser graph.
Their adjacency implies disjointness, which means there are no identical pair selec-
tions from any cell of u and any cell of v. Therefore, all the elements of each cell of u
are dispersed among all cells of v, contributing just one element to each cell of v. As
a result, every cell of u intersects with every cell of v, which implies that u and v are
adjacent in the partition graph.

Proposition 2.1.4. The number of vertices in P(g g ) is given by
                              (︁g2 )︁(︁g2 −g)︁ (︁g)︁
                                g        g
                                              ... g
                                                     .                                (2.1.1)
                                         g!
Proof:       The vertices of P(g g ) are composed of g disjoint cells, each of size g. There
     (︁g2 )︁                             (︁ 2 )︁
are g choices for the first cell, g g−g choices for the second, and so forth until gg
                                                                                         (︁ )︁

choices remain for the last cell.
      This product gives the total count of g-cell sets satisfying two criteria: (i) each
set covers the main set 1, ..., g 2 , and (ii) the cells in each set are disjoint. However,
the count does not account for the condition that the order of cells within a vertex is
irrelevant.
      Given g disjoint cells, there are g! different orderings to form a set. However, per
the irrelevance of order, these variations represent the same vertex in P(g g ). Thus,
                                (︁ 2 )︁(︁ 2 )︁ (︁ )︁
we must divide the product gg g g−g ... gg by g! to get the exact vertex count.



Proposition 2.1.5. The degree of each vertex of P(g g ) is equal to (g!)g−1 .
Proof:      Consider an arbitrary vertex v = {c1 , c2 , . . . , cg }. As each cell of vertex v
must have a nonempty intersection with each cell of an adjacent vertex, each cell of v
contributes exactly one element to every cell of the adjacent vertex. For each cell ci ,
there are g! possible ways to distribute its elements among the cells of the adjacent
vertex. Since there are g cells in v, the total number of combinations is (g!)g . However,
the order of the cells in the vertices is irrelevant. Therefore, we divide this number by
g!. Consequently, the total number of adjacent vertices to vertex v is equal to (g!)g−1 .
     Since this argument applies to an arbitrary vertex, the result holds for all ver-
tices. We conclude that the degree of the vertices in the partition graph P(g g ) is
equal to (g!)g−1 .


     Having familiarized ourselves with several recognized properties of a general par-
tition graph, our attention now turns to particular instances of this graph. We aim
to investigate their box complexes and establish the lower bounds of their chromatic
numbers by applying Theorem 1.4.1. As we will see in Example 2.1.6, we can de-
termine the lower bounds of the partition graph P(22 ) in a straightforward manner.
However, the complexity escalates significantly when we progress to the partition
graph P(3), which we will discuss in Example 2.1.7.
Example 2.1.6. Suppose g = 2 and G = P(22 ). The ground set of the vertices of
the corresponding Kneser graph to G = P(22 ) is
                      {︁                                            }︁
                  X = {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}
2. PARTITION GRAPH                                                                   40


with 6 members. The set of the vertices of Kneser graph is
                 {︂{︁               }︁ {︁            }︁ {︁            }︁}︂

which is a triangle.
     The following is the study of the chromatic number lower bounds of G:
     The Lovász bound: The box complex B(G) is homeomorphic to S 1 , so, ind(B(G)) =
1. In addition, the box complex B0 (G) is homeomorphic to S 2 , so, ind(B0 (G)) = 2.
Hence, the Lovász bound is 3.
     Dol’nikov-Kříž Bound: The maximum cardinality of sets within K (as defined in
Definition 1.1.4) is three. These sets follow one of two patterns: either all elements
in a set include i, or none do, for each i in the set 1, 2, 3, 4. Consequently, there exist
2 × 4 = 8 maximum cardinality sets in K.
     Consider a maximal simplex of K∆        ∗2
                                                , for instance,
                     {︁                        }︁ {︁                   }︁
                        {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3} ⊎ {1, 4}, {2, 4}, {3, 4} .

From this, we deduce that dim(K∆   ∗2
                                      ) = 5 and calculate cd2 (F) = n − 1 − dim K∆
                                                                                 ∗2
                                                                                    =
6 − 1 − 5 = 0. We find that this bound is not particularly informative.
     The Bárány bound: The simplicial complex K has six vertices and eight maximal
simplices, each formed by a triangle. Consider a cross polytope P in R3 , which
possesses six vertices located at the unit vectors and their corresponding antipodal
points. We assign the vertices of K to match the vertices of P . The triangular faces
of P are treated as the maximal simplices of K. With this arrangement, K is a
subcomplex of the boundary complex of P , symbolized as K ⊆ δP . Thus the Bárány
bound is d = 3.
     The Sarkaria bound: Since Bárány bound and Lovász bound are 3, then Sarkaria
bound is also 3.

     Driven by curiosity, we used the data visualization application Gephi to visualize
the partition graph P(33 ), shown in Figure 2.1. This image underlines the consid-
erable size and complexity of the graph. However, it also highlights the limitations
of relying solely on visualization for understanding such structures, underscoring the
necessity of detailed mathematical analysis.

Example 2.1.7. Suppose g = 3 and G = P(33 ) is the partition graph. The vertices
of P(33 ) are partitions of {1, 2, ..., 9} into 3 cells of size 3.

     Let X be the ground set(︁ of)︁ elements forming the vertices of the Kneser graph
KG(F) = P(33 ), then |X| = 92 = 36. Utilizing equation (2.1.1), we can derive the
cardinality of F:

                                                  3!
     The Dol’nikov-Kříž bound: Our goal is to color all elements of X with blue, red,
or white such that no set in F is entirely red or blue, although complete whiteness is
permissible. The elements of X are subsets of 1, 2, · · · , 9 with size 2. Assigning red
to the sets containing only odd numbers, blue to the sets with only even numbers,
and either blue or red to the mixed sets yields a proper coloring.
     Why is this coloring considered proper? Essentially, we want to know why no
set from F is completely red or blue. A set from F (or a vertex of the Kneser
graph) consists of all pairs of elements across all cells of a given vertex of P(33 ).
The union of all cells for every vertex of P(33 ) equals c = 1, 2, ..., 9, and the cells
of a vertex are disjoint sets of size 3. With 4 even and 5 odd numbers in the set c,
the pigeonhole principle guarantees that at least one cell contains at least two odd
numbers, and another cell contains at least two even numbers in every vertex of P(33 ).
Consequently, each set in F will always contain one set with only odd numbers and
one set with only even numbers. Thus, we can conclude that

                                       cd2 (P(33 )) = 0.

However, as we observe, this lower bound does not provide substantial information
about the chromatic number.

    The following proposition demonstrates that the clique number in this graph is
not very large.

Proposition 2.1.8. The largest clique in P(33 ) is of size four.

Proof:      Suppose the vertices u, v, x are adjacent in P(33 ). We aim to find another
vertex adjacent to all of them. Let n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 9} be an arbitrary element. This
element is in a cell of vertex u along with two other elements, and it forms a cell with
two other elements in vertex v, as well as in vertex x. These elements are all distinct
2. PARTITION GRAPH                                                                       43


because u, v, and x are adjacent. Consequently, the element n cannot be placed into
one cell with six other elements to make a new vertex adjacent to all the vertices
u, v, x. However, there are two other elements we can utilize to form a cell with the
element n in the new vertex. This approach allows us to find a 4-clique in P(33 ). It
is not possible to add another vertex adjacent to all the vertices of a 4-clique because
now the element n cannot form a cell with eight other elements, leaving no additional
elements to create a cell.


    With a similar argument, we have the following proposition:

Proposition 2.1.9. Every edge and every triangle of P(33 ) are included in exactly
one 4-clique.

Proof:       Let v and w be two adjacent vertices in P(33 ). Let n ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 9}, and
s be a common neighbour of v and w. In order to place n in a cell of s, we need
to identify and insert a pair of elements from the set {1, 2, · · · , 9} alongside n, such
that they are neither together nor with n in any cells of v and w. Since v and w
are adjacent, there are two elements from the set {1, 2, · · · , 9} that are with n in one
cell of v, and two other elements in a cell of w. Consequently, the number of choices
for elements in the same cell as n is reduced to four, specifically the elements not
present with n in the cells of v and w. There are six possible pairs of elements out of
these four elements. However, four of these pairs already exist in the cells of v and
w without n. Therefore, only two pairs of elements are available that do not already
exist in the cells of v and w, which can be used to place next to n and construct the
vertex s.
     In Proposition 2.1.8, we observed the existence of a 4-clique. This means a pair of
adjacent vertices have two common neighbours within this 4-clique. Here, we demon-
strated that this pair of vertices cannot have more than two common neighbours.
Consequently, their only common neighbours are exclusive to the 4-clique. We can
conclude that each edge and each triangle are included in only one 4-clique.

2.2      Sub-structures of Bedge P(3 )
According    to)︁ the definition of the edge box complex outlined in 1.3.1, the simplices of
Bedge P(3 ) consist of subsets taken from edge sets of complete bipartite subgraphs

found within P(33 ). Our first step in this exploration is to identify these complete
bipartite subgraphs embedded within P(33 ). This task, however, is not a simple one;
it demands a complex analysis, which we provide in the forthcoming chapters.        Never-
theless, there exist two families of complete bipartite subgraphs of Bedge P(33 ) that
                                                                              (︁     )︁

prove to be more manageable to our examination. In this section, we will introduce
these families and delve into a comprehensive analysis of their unique characteristics.

Definition 2.2.1. Some definitions of the objects that appear in this text multiple
times:

   1. neighbourhood subgraph: the bipartite graph formed by a vertex i, all of its
      neighbours in P(33 ), and the edges between them, often denoted as K1,36 =
      (i, CN(i)).

   2. neighbourhood simplex : part of Bedge P(33 ) derived from a neighbourhood

      subgraph of the vertex i, often denoted as S1,36 = {i} × {CN(i)} with the
      antipodal S36,1 = {CN(i)} × {i}.

   3. 4-clique complex : part of Bedge P(33 ) derived from a 4-clique.

    Let the Figure 2.2 be a 4-clique of P(33 )

    The Figure 2.3 is the simplicial complex in Bedge P(33 ) produced by this 4-clique

     There are 8 triangles (like {1} × {2, 3, 4}) and 6 tetrahedrons (like {1, 2} × {3, 4})
in this simplicial complex. In order to decrease the number of edges in the figure
instead of drawing all the edges of tetrahedrons we just drew four edges of each.

Also, instead of showing all the tetrahedrons, we only highlighted three of them by
light purple, light orange, and light red. We can redraw it as the following:

     In the above figure the highlighted areas represent the tetrahedrons and the curvy
triangle is a normal triangle but since its edges lie on the other edges we drew it curvy
to be visible. The triangles are also filled, they are not highlighted here in order to
be different from the tetrahedrons.
     Each vertex of P(33 ) is included within twelve distinct 4-cliques. These 4-cliques
consist of the primary vertex under consideration and all its neighbours. Now consider
a vertex and two of its 4-cliques as below

and {234567} × {1}. The following figure shows these two simplices

triangles are from the 4-clique with vertices {1, 5, 6, 7}. The blue edges are part
neighbourhood simplex that attaches two 4-clique complexes. In the real Bedge P(3 )
this simplex is much bigger than this figure because here we just considered 5 neigh-
bours of the vertex 1 but this vertex has 36 neighbours by Proposition 2.1.5.

Figure 2.7, we attempt to visualize a 4-clique complex in three dimensions. To fa-
cilitate this, we use the same colours as in Figure 2.2 to enable the reader to easily
identify correspondences between the two representations.
      An interesting property of a 4-clique complex is its symmetry: placing any of the
triangles at the top results in the same three-dimensional structure. Furthermore,
it can be deduced that the 4-clique complex is homotopy equivalent to an S 2 . This
is because it can be embedded in R3 centred around the origin and subsequently
deformed into a sphere without changing its topological properties.

      In the graph P(33 ), each vertex is adjacent to three others to form a 4-clique.
Since each vertex is adjacent to 36 other vertices,(︁ it is )︁part of 12 different 4-cliques.
This creates 12 separate 4-clique groups in Bedge P(33 ) .
      These 12 4-clique complexes converge at a central, high-dimensional structure—a
35-dimensional neighbourhood simplex. This simplex serves as a hub, linking the 4-
clique complexes via their constitutive triangles.
      In other words, each triangle belonging to a 4-clique complex is shared with a
neighbourhood simplex, while the tetrahedrons are uniquely contained within the
4-cliques themselves.
      The Figure 2.8 serves as a visual aid, depicting a section of Bedge P(33 ) formed
                                                                            (︁     )︁

    4-cliques

     Consider once again a 4-clique consisting of vertices 1, 2, 3, 4. Given that each 4-
clique in P(33 ) encompasses four vertices, we have the flexibility to examine a 4-clique
from four distinct viewpoints. Essentially, the analysis and visualizations performed
for vertex 1 can be replicated (︁for vertices 2, 3, and 4.
     Translating this to Bedge P(33 ) , it follows that each 4-clique complex is con-

nected to four separate neighbourhood simplices through its triangles. To elaborate,
each 4-clique complex has 8 triangles, with each triangle and its antipodal being a
part of a neighbourhood simplex and its antipodal respectively.
     Figure 2.9 visually represents a 4-clique complex centralized within four distinct
chains of 4-cliques, each accompanied by their respective neighbourhood simplices for
each vertex 1, 2, 3, and 4. Arrows of the same colour represent the same neighbour-
hood simplex and its antipodal.

     Before reaching the final objective of this chapter, we must establish a series of
preliminary lemmas, to set a solid foundation for our conclusion.

Lemma 2.3.1. The 4-clique complexes are disjoint.

            It is a direct result of Proposition 2.1.9. The vertices of Bedge P(33 ) are
                                                                             (︁     )︁
Proof:
the directed edges of P(33 ), and each edge is included in one 4-clique. Therefore,
there is no intersection between two or more 4-clique complexes.



Lemma 2.3.2. The set of vertices of Bedge P(33 ) is the union of the vertices of all
                                               (︁      )︁

4-clique complexes.

            Each vertex of Bedge P(33 ) is a directed edge in P(33 ). In Proposition
                                   (︁     )︁
Proof:
2.1.9 we saw each edge is included in one 4-clique, so the two directions of each edge
are included in that 4-clique. Also, in the previous lemma 2.3.1, we observed the 4-
                                        (︁ the
clique complexes are disjoint. Therefore,       )︁ union of all the vertices of the 4-cliques
is equal to the set of vertices of Bedge P(3 ) .
                                             3


The Lemma 2.3.1 and the fact that 4-clique complexes are homotopy equivalent to
S 2 lead to the following theorem:

Theorem 2.3.3. The box complex Bedge P(33 ) derived from the 4-cliques of P(33 )
                                             (︁    )︁

does not contain any sub-complex homotopy equivalent to a S 3 .

            The portion of Bedge P(33 ) formed by the 4-clique complexes consists of
                                 (︁       )︁
Proof:
a disjoint union of complexes, each homotopy equivalent to S 2 . It is important to
note that no sub-complex of S 2 can be homotopy equivalent to S 3 , as S 2 does not
possess any higher-dimensional holes.
      Moreover, the disjoint union of two or more S 2 complexes results in a discon-
nected space, while S 3 is known    to)︁be connected. Consequently, there can be no S 3
included in the part of Bedge P(33 ) formed by the 4-clique complexes.
                              (︁

This theorem ensures that there is no sub-complex of all the 4-clique complexes ho-
motopy equivalent to any S n for n ≥ 3 because each S n includes S m for m < n.

    In Theorem 2.3.5,
simplices from Bedge P(33 ) , the neighbourhood simplices (introduced in Definition

2.2.1), to the 4-clique complexes and examine the existence of an S 3 in this complex.
We do it by exploring the intersections between neighbourhood simplices and 4-clique
complexes.
     Before delving into the proof of the theorem, it is essential to grasp the concept
of triangulation. In a broad sense, triangulation refers to the transformation of topo-
logical spaces into piecewise linear spaces via the selection of a homeomorphism to a
suitable simplicial complex. Spaces that are homeomorphic to a simplicial complex
are known as triangulable.
Definition 2.3.4. A triangulation of a topological space X is a homeomorphism
t : K → X where K is a simplicial complex.
     An illustrative example of this concept is the triangulation of a 3-dimensional
ball B 3 , which results in a filled tetrahedron.
Theorem 2.3.5. There is no S 3 in the portion of Bedge P(33 ) formed by the 4-clique
                                                       (︁    )︁

complexes and neighbourhood simplicies.
Proof:      To construct a triangulation of S 3 , we seek a collection of tetrahedra glued
together along their faces. However, upon examination of the 4-clique complexes and
the neighbourhood simplices, we conclude that such a collection does not exist. This
conclusion is reached by analyzing the intersections between 4-cliques and neighbour-
hood simplices. Let C be a 4-clique and Cs be the 4-clique complex of Bedge P(33 )
                                                                                  (︁     )︁

corresponding to the 4-clique C.
     In the subsequent analysis, we will examine different cases of intersection between
4-clique complexes and neighbourhood simplices.
   • Intersection of a 4-clique and a neighbourhood simplex:
     Recall that the simplices of Bedge P(33 ) are subsets of the ordered edges of
                                         (︁    )︁

     the complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ). Let i be one of the vertices of Cs ,
     and let S1,36 = {i} × {CN(i)}. Then, Cs ∩ S1,36 = {i} × {CN(i)} ∩ Cs , which
     contains all three ordered edges {i} × {.} of C where {.} is other vertices of C.
     Thus, |Cs ∩ S1,36 | = 3. If i is not one of the vertices of the 4-clique C, then
     Cs ∩ S1,36 = ∅. The same analysis applies to a S36,1 . Since a 4-clique has 4
     vertices, it shares 4 triangles with 4 neighbourhood simplices and 4 triangles
     with their antipodals.

   • Intersection of two different neighbourhood simplices on a 4-clique:
      Let i, j be two vertices of the 4-clique C, and let S1,36 = {i} × {CN(i)} and
        ′
      S1,36 = {j} × {CN(j)}. Obviously, since i ̸= j, these two simplices have no
      intersections on this 4-clique or anywhere else. However, each of them shares
      one vertex with the antipodal of the other one on this 4-clique and nowhere
      else. Namely, S1,36 ∩ S36,1
                             ′
                                  = {i} × {j} and S36,1 ∩ S1,36
                                                           ′

     Additionally, if two different neighbourhood simplices connected to this 4-clique
     are not antipodal to each other, they are not part of another 4-clique. If both
     of them were part of another 4-clique, then both vertices i and j would be
     included in that 4-clique, and i and j would be adjacent in the corresponding
     4-clique. We proved in Proposition 2.1.9 that each edge is included in only one
     4-clique. Thus, these two neighbourhood simplices do not share anything with
     other 4-clique complexes.
     It is clear that any two antipodal neighbourhood simplices do not share any
     elements. As previously demonstrated in Figure 2.8, these antipodal neigh-
     bourhood simplices are part of 12 distinct 4-cliques, sharing a triangle with
     each 4-clique complex.

     In this chapter, we delve deeper into the structure of the graph P(33 ), focusing
specifically on the analysis of vertex pairs and triples. Initially, we establish a par-
ticular relationship between the vertex pairs, leading to their categorization into four
equivalence classes. This classification is predicated on the existence of a permutation
of Sym(33 ) within two vertex pairs of a class. Subsequently, we classify vertex triples
into equivalence classes, a task more complex than the pairs. The results of these
analyses provide the basis for the succeeding chapter, where we aim to identify and
categorize all complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ).
     Prior to our exploration of the vertex pairs within the specific graph P(33 ), we
show that any general partition graph P(g g ) exhibits vertex-transitivity.
     Let H be a group acting on some set X and x ∈ X. The stabilizer and orbit of
x by group H are

                            stabH (x) = {γ ∈ H : γ(x) = x}                             (3.0.1)
                            orbH (x) = {γ(x) : γ ∈ H}                                  (3.0.2)

The permutations of a symmetric group Sym(n) are bijective functions. Therefore,
the group Sym(g 2 ) is an automorphism on P(g g ) because each permutation maps one
vertex to another.

Proposition 3.0.1. The partition graph P(g g ) is vertex-transitive.

Proof: (Proof by Examination of Structure)
Consider each vertex of P(g g ) as a partition of {1, 2, . . . , g 2 } into g cells, each of size
g. Hence, these vertices exhibit a consistent structure. Let v and w be two vertices
of P(g g ) as the following:

                                 v = {{v1,1 , v1,2 , . . . , v1,g }, . . . , {vg,1 , . . . , vg,g }}
                                 w = {{w1,1 , w1,2 , . . . , w1,g }, . . . , {wg,1 , . . . , wg,g }}.

To find permutations mapping vertex v to w, we first align the cells of v with those
of w, map vi,j to wi,j , and subsequently remove the brackets. As illustrated below:

                                                     cell v                  cell vg
                                           (︃ ⏟       ⏞⏞ 1       ⏟       ⏟ ⏞⏞ ⏟ )︃
                                              v1,1 v1,2 . . . v1,g . . . vg,1 . . . vg,g
                                             w1,1 w1,2 . . . w1,g . . . wg,1 . . . wg,g
                                             ⏞        ⏟⏟         ⏞ ⏞ ⏟⏟ ⏞
                                                    cell w1                 cell wg


which is a permutation of the elements in {1, 2, . . . , g 2 } that maps v to w.

Proof: (Proof by Application of the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem)
We define H = Sym(g 2 ), which acts on the vertices of P(g g ). Thus, |H| = g 2 !. The
orbit-stabilizer theorem then suggests the following relation for a vertex x of P(g g ):

                                               |H| = |stabH (x)| · |orbH (x)|.

Since the stabilizer of x, denoted stabH (x), encompasses all permutations of g ele-
ments for each cell of x and all permutations of g cells of x, we find that |stabH (x)| =
                                    (g 2 )!
(g!)g+1 . Therefore, |orbH (x)| = (g!) g+1 . Earlier in Proposition 2.1.4, we established
                                                                              2    2
                                                                            (gg )(g g−g)...(gg)
that the number of vertices of P(g g ) equates to                                      g!
                                                                                                  . It is readily apparent
that |orbH (x)| equals the number of vertices:
(︁g2 )︁(︁g2 −g)︁         (︁g)︁
  g       g
                   ...    g        1 (︂ (g 2 )! )︂(︂ (g 2 − g)! )︂ (︂ (g 2 − (g − 2)g)! )︂(︂ (g 2 − (g − 1)g)! )︂
                                 =                                ···
              g!                   g! g!(g 2 − g)! g!(g 2 − 2g)!             g!g!                    g!
                                       2
                                    (g )!
                                 =         = |orbH (x)|.
                                   (g!)g+1

Given that only a single orbit exists for each vertex of P(g g ), we conclude that this
graph is indeed vertex-transitive.

3.1      Vertex Pairs of P(33)
In this section, we turn our attention to complete bipartite subgraphs in which one
side is composed solely of two vertices within P(33 ). To accomplish this, we explore
the different possibilities for all pairs of vertices in P(33 ).
     Recall that each vertex in P(33 ) represents a partition of the set 1, 2, . . . , 9 into
three cells, each containing three elements. Two vertices, u and v, are connected by
an edge if and only if every cell of u intersects with every cell of v.
     For clarity and convenience, we may depict a vertex x = {x1 , x2 , x3 }, where each
xi represents a cell {a, b, c}, i ∈ 1, 2, 3, and a, b, c ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 9}. Sometimes we
denote a vertex in an informal but practical table form as follows:

                                             abc
                                             def
                                             ghi

     This visual representation aids in understanding and communicating the struc-
tural arrangements of vertices in P(33 ).

3.1.1     Definition
Each vertex pair of type n can be succinctly represented using a 3 × 3 grid pattern.
In this configuration, the union of the elements in each row corresponds to a cell of
one vertex, while the union of elements in each column corresponds to a cell in the
other vertex of the pair. Due to this arrangement, the shared elements between the
cells of the two vertices occupy the same cell in this grid.
     Let us consider vertices v and w with their respective cells given by v = {v1 , v2 , v3 }
and w = {w1 , w2 , w3 }. The grid pattern for the vertex pair v, w would then be as
follows, where each row represents a cell from v and each column represents a cell
from w:

                                v1 ∩ w1   v1 ∩ w 2   v1 ∩ w3
                                v2 ∩ w1   v2 ∩ w 2   v2 ∩ w3
                                v3 ∩ w1   v3 ∩ w 2   v3 ∩ w3

                         Table 3.1: The grid pattern of v and w

     It is important to note that reordering the rows or columns of the grid does not
alter the vertex pair. Additionally, transposing the grid (i.e., swapping rows with
columns, akin to the transpose of a matrix) also leaves the pair unchanged. However,
post-transposition, the cells of v become the columns and those of w become the rows.

     As an example, consider a specific pair of vertices, v and w. In their grid pattern
representation, the intersections of the cells of v and w are explicitly shown. Here,
the rows correspond to the cells of v and the columns to the cells of w:

                789 756                                                   89 7
                 v   w                                      The grid pattern of v and w

     The following presents a categorization of vertex pairs within the graph P(33 ),
as classified by their respective grid patterns. We initially focus on introducing vertex
pairs’ grid patterns of types 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Later, in Proposition 3.1.3, it will be
demonstrated that these are the exclusive types of grid patterns that can be attributed
to the vertex pairs.

Definition 3.1.1. Consider the elements a1 , . . . , a9 , each belonging to the set {1, 2, . . . , 9}
such that ai ̸= aj whenever i ̸= j, and let v and w represent a pair of vertices within
P(33 ). We define the vertex pair to be of a particular type - 3, 5, 6, 7, or 9 - if the grid
pattern of the pair corresponds to the patterns shown in Table 3.3. For each vertex
pair v, w, we use T(v, w) = n to denote that v, w are of type n. Given that each grid
pattern’s uniqueness extends to swapping rows, swapping columns, and transposition,
we hereby establish these grids as the representatives of their respective types. We
will refer to these as the standard grid pattern.
     As the number of non-empty locations within each type’s grid pattern is unique,
we have chosen to denote the pattern type by the quantity of these non-empty spots
on its grid. It is noteworthy that type 3, which refers to a pair of identical vertices
within P(33 ), will not be of interest in our study, due to the fact that all the vertices
of P(33 ) are distinct.

Lemma 3.1.2. If two vertices v and w within the graph are neither identical nor
adjacent, it follows that there must exist at least one cell within v and another within
w that share a pair of elements.

Proof:       Let us consider v and w, two distinct vertices that are not adjacent.
Recalling Definition 2.1.1, which outlines the conditions for adjacency, we note that
there must be at least one cell within v and another within w that are disjoint. Given
that there is no prescribed order to the cells within a vertex, we can, without loss of
generality, posit that v1 ∩ w3 = ∅.
     The subsequent examination proceeds in two branches:

   • Suppose cell v1 is also disjoint from another cell in w, say w2 . In this case,
     v1 must be equivalent to w1 . If we were to assume that v2 is equivalent to

      another cell of w, e.g., w2 , this would necessitate that v3 is equivalent to w3 .
      Consequently, we would conclude that v equals w, a conclusion that contradicts
      our initial assumption. Therefore, v2 cannot be equivalent to any cell of w,
      and it must share one element with either w2 or w3 , and two elements with the
      remaining cell. The same argument can be applied to cell v3 .

   • Should cell v1 share elements with all other cells of w apart from w3 , it would
     thus share elements with both w2 and w1 . Consequently, it would share one
     element with one of these cells, and two elements with the other.

     Thus, regardless of the specific scenario, if vertices v and w are distinct and not
adjacent, there must exist at least one cell of v and one cell of w sharing a pair of
their elements.




3.1.2     Equivalencies
In the previous section, we introduced the type of vertex pairs. In this section, we
prove all the vertex pairs of P(33 ) are of type 3, 5, 6, 7, or 9, and all the pairs of the
same type are equivalent.
Proposition 3.1.3. The vertex pairs of the graph P(33 ) are of type 3, 5, 6, 7, or 9.
3. VERTEX CLASSIFICATION OF P(33 )                                                      57


Proof:     Let v and w be a pair of vertices. The examination of their type follows
three primary cases:

   • When v = w, the respective cells are identical. As a result, the corresponding
     grid pattern of the pair v, w conforms to the type 3 pattern depicted in Table
     3.3.

   • In the instance where vertices v and w are adjacent, each cell of v shares a single
     element with every cell of w. Hence, the grid pattern of an adjacent pair aligns
     with the type-9 pattern.

   • Owing to the graph’s vertex-transitivity, we may select a single vertex and
     examine all possible vertex pairs containing this fixed vertex, the results of
     which can then be extended to the entirety of the vertices. For the purposes
     of this examination, let v = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}, with w a vertex of
     P(33 ) such that v ̸= w and is not adjacent to v. We now assess the potential
     configurations of the cells of w.
     Based on Lemma 3.1.2, we understand that there exists a cell in v sharing a
     pair of elements with a cell of w. Without loss of generality, we may assume
     this pair to be {1, 2}. Given that {1, 2, 3} is a cell of v, the position of element
     3 within w becomes crucial for our analysis. Figure 3.1 visualises the following
     case analysis for vertices of P(33 ) where each dot within the vertices of this
     diagram symbolises an available space for an element from {1, 2, . . . , 9}:

        – If 3 is placed within the same cell as {1, 2} in w, then v and w share the cell
          {1, 2, 3}. If they were to share any other cell, they would effectively become
          the same vertex, a contradiction. The remaining elements to be allocated
          to the cells of w are {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The sets {4, 5, 6} and {7, 8, 9}, which
          form cells of v, cannot be repeated as cells within w. Hence, the elements
          from these sets are split across the remaining cells in w. This leads to a
          grid pattern of the v, w pair which corresponds to type 5.

          w. Here, another element from {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, say 4, is placed next to
          {1, 2}. The elements 5 and 6, which share a cell with 4 in v, can either be

        placed in a single cell of w or distributed across two different cells. This
        bifurcation of possibilities results in either a type-5 or type-6 grid pattern,
        or finally a type-7 grid pattern depending on the final placement of 7, 8,
        and 9. The details of this result are as follows:
          ∗ In the scenario where the pair 5, 6 resides in the same cell as 3, it
            necessitates the placement of the remaining elements, 7, 8, and 9, into
            the last cell. As a consequence, the grid pattern that emerges for
            vertices v and w is:

            the standard type-5 grid, as found in Table 3.3.
          ∗ Conversely, should the pair 5, 6 be allocated to a cell not including 3,
            then any possible arrangement of 7, 8, and 9 in the remaining cells
            leads to a grid pattern of type 6 as per Table 3.3:

            occupy the remaining slots in any configuration. Consequently, the
            grid associated with the vertex pair v, w now aligns with the type 7

Theorem 3.1.4. All vertex pairs of P(33 ) can be categorized into 4 equivalence
classes where each class is the orbit of a pair of type 5, 6, 7, or 9 containing all vertex
pairs of the same type.
Proof:      First we prove that type of a pair is preserved under a permutation. Let
the following grid pattern, represents the pair v, w:
                                      A1    A2   A3
                                      A4    A5   A6
                                      A7    A8   A9
Since the cells of a vertex are disjoint sets, the intersections in the grid pattern of
a vertex pair are disjoint too, to recall the general form of a grid pattern look at
Table 3.1. Let σ ∈ Sym(9). Therefore, the sets Ai with i = 1, 2, . . . , 9 and thus their
3. VERTEX CLASSIFICATION OF P(33 )                                                      60


images under permutation σ are disjoint (if x ∈ σ(Aα )∩σ(Aβ ) for α, β ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 9},
then σ −1 (x) ∈ Aα ∩ Aβ which is a contradiction). Not only is the emptiness of Ai
unchanged under σ, but also, the size of Ai and its image are the same because Ai
are disjoint sets, and permutation is a bijection function. Hence, |Ai | = |σ(Ai )| for
i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 9} and thus, the grid pattern of the pair σ(v), σ(w) is of the same
pattern as the grid pattern of v, w. Consequently, T(v, w) = T(σ(v), σ(w)).
Second, we show if v, w and p, q are of the same type, then there exists a σ ∈ Sym(9)
such that σ(v) = p and σ(w) = q. Let the following be the grid pattern of v, w and
p, q, where v and p are the rows, and w and q are the columns of their grids:

             A1    A2   A3                             B1      B2   B3
             A4    A5   A6                             B4      B5   B6
             A7    A8   A9                             B7      B8   B9
        the grid pattern of v, w                  the grid pattern of p, q

      Since v, w and p, q are of the same type, we can swap the rows and columns
of their grids so they follow the standard pattern of that type in Table 3.3. Then
|Ai | = |Bi | for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 9}. Hence, the permutation σ(Ai ) = Bi is the desired
permutation mapping vi ∩ wj to pi ∩ qj for i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Therefore each cell of v
and w is mapped to a cell of p and q respectively. Thus, σ(v) = p and σ(w) = q.
Since all pairs are of type 5, 6, 7, or 9 by Proposition 3.1.3, here we proved all pairs
of vertices are included in one of the orbits of pairs of types 5, 6, 7, or 9.

Let x, y and u, v be two vertex pairs. Since the vertices of a vertex pair are not
ordered, the equivalence of these pairs implies the existence of permutations such
that σ(x) = u and σ(y) = v, as well as the existence of other permutations where
γ(x) = v and γ(y) = u.
     In the context of pairs of type 9, which are endpoints of edges within the graph,
the above result can be understood as the graph being both edge-transitive and arc-
transitive.

3.1.3     Size of the Equivalence Classes
Recall the concepts of orbit and stabilizer from equation (3.0.1). For a group H acting
on the set X and an element x ∈ X, the orbit-stabilizer theorem states:

                              |H| = |stabH (x)| · |orbH (x)|

Consider, for example, H = Sym(9). Here, the permutations (12) and (14)(26)(35)
belong to stabH (v), while orbH (v) includes all vertices, reflecting the fact that this
graph is vertex-transitive. Recall the proof of Proposition 3.0.1, in which we demon-
strated that the size of an orbit of a vertex in a partition graph equals the number of
3. VERTEX CLASSIFICATION OF P(33 )                                                    61


its vertices. In the case of the partition graph P(33 ), the number of vertices is 280,
as shown in equation (2.1.1).

Enumeration of type-9 pairs
Consider a pair of vertices v and w that exhibit the type-9 grid pattern, as referenced
in Table 3.3. Assume H to be the stabilizer of v. Then, we can define stabH (w) as
{γ ∈ Sym(9) : γ(w) = w, γ(v) = v}, which implies stabH (w) ⊆ H.
     Let σ ∈ Sym(9). If σ swaps the columns or rows of the grid pattern, both vertices
v and w remain unaffected. Consequently, |stabH (w)| can be calculated as 3! · 3!, or
62 .
     The orbit of w under H, denoted as orbH (w), includes the neighbours of v, as the
elements of orbH (w) form new vertices while maintaining the adjacency relationship.
By applying the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we find

                                                  |H|      64
                   degree(v) = |orbH (w)| =               = 2 = 36.
                                              |stabH (w)|  6

This result aligns with Proposition 2.1.5. Applying the degree sum formula yields
                                     280 × 36
                             |E| =            = 140 × 36.
                                         2
Therefore, 140 × 36 represents the total count of type-9 pairs.

Enumeration of type-5 pairs
We can determine the number of vertices in a type-5 relationship with a given vertex
by employing two distinct methods: the first approach involves calculating the size
of the orbit and then determining the size of the stabilizer using the orbit-stabilizer
theorem, while the second method involves directly enumerating the vertices in a
type-5 relationship with a specific vertex. We shall initially explore the utilization of
the orbit-stabilizer theorem.
     Consider a pair of vertices, v and w, which exhibit a grid pattern characteristic
of type 5, as illustrated below:

               123 123                                        123
               456 457                                              45 6
               789 896                                              7 89
                v   w                             The grid pattern of v and w of type 5

                      Table 3.9: An example of a pair of type 5
3. VERTEX CLASSIFICATION OF P(33 )                                                     62


     Here, a permutation conserves v and w only if it maps the cell {1, 2, 3} to itself,
and transforms {4, 5} to {8, 9} while maps 7 to 6. There are 3! = 6 ways to permute
the three elements within the set {1, 2, 3}.
     There are 2! = 2 ways to permute the elements within each of the sets {4, 5} and
{8, 9}. Since the permutations within these sets are independent, there are 2 × 2 = 4
permutations in total.
     Lastly, the sets {4, 5} and {8, 9} can be swapped with each other or remain the
same. Therefore, there are 2! = 2 ways to permute these two sets. Therefore,

                                  |stabH (w)| = 3! × 23
and
                                                 64
                               |orbH (w)| =         3
                                                      = 33 .                       (3.1.1)
                                              3! × 2
     This signifies that there exist 33 vertices maintaining a type-5 relationship with
                                                                       3
vertex v. Therefore, the total number of type-5 pairs in P(33 ) is 3 ×2802
                                                                            = 140 × 33 .
     To directly derive the number of vertices sharing a type-5 relationship with ver-
tex v, we can enumerate the different possibilities for these vertices. Diagram 3.2
encapsulates this counting process. Since v and w are of type 5, we start the diagram
with a cell that these two vertices share. Then fit the cells of v one by one at each
step of the diagram into the cells of w. The newly added numbers at each step are
coloured red. The details of the diagram are as the following:
     Two vertices of type 5 share a cell. To build the vertex w there are three choices
to fix a cell. Pick {1,2,3} as the shared cell. The next step, as shown in diagram
3.2, is to fit another cell of v to w in a way that they stay in a type-5 relationship.
Take cell {4, 5, 6} from v, we cannot place all of the elements of this cell in a cell of
w because it makes the two vertices the same, so, put two of them in the second cell
and the third one in the third cell (three choices), one option is to put {4, 5} together,
and 6 in a different cell of w. Next, take the last cell of v, {7, 8, 9}. There are three
ways to put one of 7, 8, or 9 in the second cell and two of them in the third cell of
w which produces three more possibilities. All in all, there are 33 possible vertices to
be in a type-5 relationship with vertex v.

Enumeration of type-6 pairs
The process of enumerating type-6 pairs can be approached in two distinct ways:
using the orbit-stabilizer theorem, or employing direct counting. The following section
employs both methods.
     Consider two vertices v and w of type-6 grid pattern as illustrated in Table
3.10. Notably, the two vertices do not share a cell, yet they do share three distinct
pairs of elements, each pair sourced from a unique cell. Any permutation that either
maps the shared pairs together or leaves them as they are also has the effect of
3. VERTEX CLASSIFICATION OF P(33 )                                                   63

                   Table 3.10: An example of a type 6 vertex pair

stabilizing the vertices v and w. Given the existence of three shared pairs, there are
3! permutations for the three pairs. Additionally, within each set, there are 2! = 2
possible permutations for the two elements. As there are three such sets, the total
number of internal permutations becomes 23 . Consequently, the size of the stabilizer
is expressed as:
                                 |stabH (w)| = 3 × 23 .
From this, we can compute the size of the orbit as follows:
                                             64
                            |orbH (w)| =          = 33 × 2.
                                           3 × 23
Consequently, there exist 33 × 2 distinct vertices in a type-6 relationship with v. As
                                             3
a result, the number of all type-6 pairs is 3 ×2×280
                                                2
                                                     = 280 × 33 .
     For direct counting of the vertices in a type-6 relationship with v, we apply a
similar approach to the one employed for counting the type-5 pairs. This process is
visualized in the diagram of Figure 3.3. The total number of possibilities obtained
from the diagram is 9 × 2 × 3 × 3 (9 is the number of possible pairs that the diagram
starts with). However, since three pairs are shared between v and w, this total number
must be divided by 3. Overall, the number of feasible vertices in a type-6 relationship
with v is 9×2×3×3
              3
                  = 33 × 2.
     The total amount derived from the diagram is 32 × 2 × 3 × 3 but since three pairs
are shared between v and w, the total amount must be divided by 3. All together,
            2
there are 3 ×2×3×3
               3
                   = 33 × 2 feasible vertices in type-6 relationship with v.

Enumeration of type-7 pairs
Take the two vertices v and w of type 7 from Table 3.11. It can be observed that

               123 124                                          12 3

                   Table 3.11: An example of a type-7 vertex pair

vertices of type 7 do not share a cell, although they share two pairs of numbers, each
pair drawn from a distinct cell. The permutations that map the pair 1, 2 to 8, 9 and
leave all other elements fixed form the stabH (w). Therefore, the size of the stabilizer
is given by:
                                    |stabH (w)| = 23
and consequently, the size of the orbit can be computed as:
                                              64
                               |orbH (w)| =    3
                                                 = 34 × 2.

From this, we ascertain that there are 3 ×2×280
                                             2
                                                   = 280 × 34 realizable type-7 pairs in
P(33 ).
     Direct counting of vertices in a type-7 relationship with v is illustrated in Figure
3.4. From the first step of the diagram, there are 9 possible choices for fixing a pair.
With two shared pairs between v and w, the total number of feasible vertices w in a
type-7 relationship with vertex v is 9×2×6×3

       Given the correspondence between edges and type-9 pairs, we can compute the
quantity of non-edges in the graph. By subtracting the number of edges, or equiva-
lently
(︁280)︁ the number of type-9 pairs (equal to 140 × 36), from the total possible pairs
   2
       , we obtain 140 × 243 non-edges.
       Notably, this figure is equivalent to the total count of pairs of types 5, 6, and 7.
Consequently, no other categories of pairs exist within this graph.
       This observation confirms the conclusion of Theorem 3.1.4, reinforcing the claim
that the identified types of pairs provide a comprehensive classification within this
graph. Therefore, the typology serves as a valuable tool in understanding and ana-
lyzing the graph’s structure.


3.2      Vertex Triples of P(33)
To fully comprehend the structure of the graph P(33 ), merely analyzing vertex pairs
is insufficient. In this chapter, we will broaden our focus to include vertex triples,
extending the analysis previously conducted on pairs.
     This analysis is useful in Theorem 4.1.14 which identifies all the bipartite sub-
graphs of P(33 ).

3.2.1     Definition
We will now define a pattern for triples that generalizes the pattern established in
Table 3.1 for vertex pairs.
    Consider the tree vertices v = {v1 , v2 , v3 }, w = {w1 , w2 , w3 }, and u = {u1 , u2 , u3 }.
This triple can be represented as a 3 × 3 × 3 cube pattern. We express this cube using
three 3 × 3 grid patterns as follows, with k = 1, 2, 3:
3. VERTEX CLASSIFICATION OF P(33 )                                                             66


                         v1 ∩ w1 ∩ uk     v1 ∩ w2 ∩ uk        v1 ∩ w3 ∩ uk
                         v2 ∩ w1 ∩ uk     v2 ∩ w2 ∩ uk        v2 ∩ w3 ∩ uk
                         v3 ∩ w1 ∩ uk     v3 ∩ w2 ∩ uk        v3 ∩ w3 ∩ uk

                    Table 3.12: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u

     A fitting analogy for this cube pattern is the familiar Rubik’s cube. Each unit
of the cube pattern can be viewed as a small cube within the Rubik’s cube, and each
grid corresponds to a layer of the Rubik’s cube. However, the layer movements of a
Rubik’s cube do not apply to the cube pattern of a vertex triple.
     The union of the units of the i-th row of all grids forms a cell of vertex v, the
union of the units of the j-th column of all grids constitutes a cell of vertex w, and
the union of all units of the k-th grid creates a cell of vertex u, for i, j, k = 1, 2, 3.
Let each cell of the cube pattern of vertices v, w, u be Ai,j,k = vi ∩ wj ∩ uk . Then, the
cells of these vertices can be found as the union of 9 units of the cube pattern:
                        3
                       ⋃︂                        3
                                                ⋃︂                        3
                                                                         ⋃︂
                vi =        (Ai,j,k ),   wj =        (Ai,j,k ),   uk =        (Ai,j,k ).   (3.2.1)
                       j,k=1                    i,k=1                    i,j=1

Given the cube pattern of three vertices, we can now rigorously identify the cells
of each vertex. Subsequently, we can derive the grid patterns of the vertex pairs
included in the triple and determine their respective types. Recall the grid pattern of
two vertices in Table 3.1. For example, consider the first unit of the first row of the grid
pattern for vertices v and w. This unit corresponds to the intersection of the union of
all units within the first rows of their cube pattern                    ⋃︁3 of all units within
                                                           ⋃︁3and the union
the first columns of their cube pattern, denoted as j,k=1 A1,j,k ∩ i,k=1 Ai,1,k = v1 ∩w1 .
       A vertex triple is classified as type r, s, t if the pairs within the triple are of types
r, s, and t, where r, s, t ∈ {5, 6, 7, 9}. In Proposition 3.1.3, we observed that all
distinct vertex pairs of P(33 ) can be categorized into four equivalence classes. For
vertex triples, the number of equivalence classes increases.
       While vertex pairs of the same type are equivalent—indicating the existence of at
least one automorphism (permutation) mapping one pair to another—this property
does not hold true for all vertex triples of the same type. Nevertheless, these vertex
triples can still be organized into equivalence classes.
       To count the number of possible     types of a triple, let r, s, t be a triple type with
r, s, t ∈ {5, 6, 7, 9}. There are 43 choices to make this triple type, where r, s, and
                                    (︁ )︁

t are distinct. There are 4 choices where r = s = t, and there are 4 × 3 = 12 ways
to build the triple type where two of them are equal and the third one is distinct.
Therefore, there are 4 + 4 + 12 = 20 choices for the type of triple. Next lemma shows
that two of the triple types are not possible.
Lemma 3.2.1. There are no triples of type 5,5,9 and 5,6,9 in P(33 ).
3. VERTEX CLASSIFICATION OF P(33 )                                                             67


Proof:       Let a, b, and c be three vertices such that T(a, b) = 9 and T(a, c) =
T(b, c) = 5. So, c has a common cell with b like b1 and a common cell with a like
a1 . Since T(a, b) = 9, we know a1 ∩ b1 ̸= ∅. However, the cells of a vertex must be
disjoint. Hence, there is no triple of type 5,5,9.
Consider the same vertices a and b with T(a, b) = 9. Let c to be a vertex such that
T(a, c) = 5 and T(b, c) = 6. Let a1 be the common cell of a and c. On one hand,
T(b, c) = 6 and thus for two cells b1 and b2 of b we have |a1 ∩ b1 | = 2 and |a1 ∩ b2 | = 1.
On the other hand, T(a, b) = 9 and thus |a1 ∩ b1 | = 1 which is a contradiction.
Therefore, there is no triple of type 5,6,9.

This lemma can be confirmed by [1].
     The following definition establishes a notation for the number of triples of a
certain type.

Definition 3.2.2. [1] Given two vertices v and w of type k, the number of vertices
u that are of type i with v and of type j with w is denoted as pkij .

      Some of the values we have computed so far include p599 = 12, p999 = 2, p799 = 4,
and p699 = 4 which are the number of the common neighbours of the vertex pairs of
different types. If the reader is interested in further values of pkij for i, j, k = 3, 9, 7, 6, 5,
they can be found in reference [1]. However, please note that in the cited work,
the types are labelled differently: types 3, 9, 7, 6, 5 in our paper correspond to types
0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in the cited work.

3.2.2      Equivalencies
Later in Section 4.1.2, we will require the equivalence classes of potential vertex triples
that do not contain a pair of type 9 in order to examine their common neighbors.
To this end, we will undertake a classification of vertex triples in this section. Table
3.13 provides a summary of this classification, illustrating the number of equivalence
classes that exist for triples of a specific type.
     The process of classifying triples of the same kind into respective equivalence
classes varies depending on the specific type of the triple. Nevertheless, the method-
ology employed remains consistent across all types. In the following, we elaborate on
this technique through an examination of a specific triple type. Detailed proofs for
other triple types, while conceptually similar, are rather extensive and have therefore
been relegated to Appendix A for the sake of brevity and clarity in the main body of
the text.

Lemma 3.2.3. All the vertex triples of type 5,5,5 can be classified into two orbits.

Proof:       Given the equivalence of all vertex pairs of type 5, we may arbitrarily
select a pair of this type, denoted v, w, and explore various ways for constructing a

third vertex, u, such that T(v, u) = 5 and T(w, u) = 5. Without loss of generality,
consider v, w exhibiting the following grid pattern:

              123 123                                              123

                     Table 3.14: An example of a pair of type 5

     As asserted in the upcoming Lemma 4.1.9, if vertices of a triple exhibit pairwise
type 5 relationships, they necessarily share a common cell. Thus, as v and w share
cell {1, 2, 3}, any newly formed vertex must have the same cell. The next cell of
the new vertex must include two elements from cell {4, 5, 6}. These two elements
are either distributed across two different cells in w, namely {4, 6} or {5, 6} or are
grouped together, i.e., {4, 5}.
     Denote u1 as a new vertex that combines elements 4 and 6 into a single cell, and
u2 as a new vertex that unites elements 4 and 5 within the same cell. Observe that
generating a third vertex grouping elements 5 and 6 within a cell follows the same
process as constructing u1 , thereby obviating the need for separate consideration.
Consequently, u1 can be generated in two analogous cases. The resulting vertex
configurations for u1 and u2 are as follows:


                          u1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 6, .}, {5, ., .}}
                          u2 = {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, .}, {6, ., .}}.

As always, each dot denotes an empty slot in a cell.
     The third cell of v, denoted as {7, 8, 9}, needs to be distributed among the
remaining cells of u1 and u2 . However, the assignment of these elements is subject to
the constraint that T(u, w) = 5.
     Examining u1 , we find that the set {7, 8, 9} can be distributed across the second
and third cells in three distinct ways. Therefore, a vertex equivalent to u1 can be
constructed in 2 × 3 = 6 ways.
     In the case of u2 , placing 7 in the same cell with 4 and 5 is prohibited because it
would result in u2 = w. Consequently, the set {7, 8, 9} can be assigned to u2 in only
two unique ways.
     In total, we have 6 + 2 = 8 unique configurations to create the third vertex u.
Using the notation in Definition 3.2.2, we deduce that P555 = 8. Since this conclusion
aligns with the reference [1], it confirms the absence of any other choice for the third
vertex, thereby classifying all triples of type 5,5,5.
     To illustrate, consider the following examples of u1 and u2 :

                            u1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 6, 8}, {5, 7, 9}}
                            u2 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 9}, {6, 8, 7}}.

The corresponding cube patterns for the triples v, w, u1 and v, w, u2 are:

                123
                                                    4                              8 9

    Table 3.16: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u2 of the second kind of type
    5,5,5.

     A vertex triple a, b, c of type 5,5,5 is considered of the first kind if its cube pattern
aligns with the v, w, u1 cube pattern. Conversely, a triple of type 5,5,5 is of the second
kind if its cube pattern conforms to the v, w, u2 cube pattern. A permutation that
maps the corresponding units of the cube pattern of two triples enables the mapping
of the triples to each other.

     The non-equivalence of these two classes is validated later by Lemma 4.1.8, which
confirms that vertices of the first kind share six neighbours, whereas those of the
second kind do not share any neighbours.



     It is important to note that equivalence is precluded when two triples belong
to different types, given the lack of equivalence between the pairs. If two triples of
identical type are equivalent, then a permutation exists that maps pairs of the same
type to one another.

4.1     Maximal Complete Bipartite Subgraphs of P(33)
In this section, we seek to comprehensively examine the maximal complete bipartite
subgraphs of P(33 ). We start by scrutinizing the vertex pairs in our graph, focus-
ing on uncovering the potential bipartite subgraphs. This involves systematically
identifying common neighbors for vertex pairs and iterating the process by seeking
common neighbors for those common neighbors, as elaborated in Remark 4.1.1. We
leverage this method to construct complete bipartite graphs from the identified pairs
of vertices.
     Our preliminary categorization in previous chapter yielded four distinct equiv-
alence classes for vertex pairs. In this chapter, we show this classification extends

to the bipartite graphs constructed from these pairs, resulting in four corresponding
equivalence classes. In the ensuing discussions, we present a proof that these con-
structed bipartite subgraphs are the only maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of
P(33 ). This serves as a cornerstone for our comprehension of P(33 ) and its bipartite
subgraphs.
     The importance of understanding these maximal complete bipartite subgraphs
extends to the study of the edge box complex Bedge (G) in the next section.

4.1.1    Construction from Vertex Pairs
The reason we categorized the pairs in the previous chapter is to introduce a method
to construct complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ). This method, formally explained
in Remark 4.1.1, involves finding the common neighbours of a pair of vertices and
finding the common neighbours of these common neighbours. We start by explaining
how we intend to find the common neighbours of a pair.
      In the process of identifying a common neighbor u for two vertices v and w, we
adopt a sequential approach.
      We commence by selecting a cell from either vertex v or w, without loss of
generality, say from v. This chosen cell is then distributed across all cells of u, with
each cell of u receiving exactly one element from the chosen cell of v. This process
ensures that every cell of u has at least one element in common with the chosen cell
of v.
      Subsequently, we pick another cell from v and distribute its elements across the
cells of u. This distribution is done such that no two elements from the selected cells
of v and w co-occur in any cell of u.
      We continue this distribution process for the third cell of v, ensuring at each
stage that the intersection of any cell of u with each cell of both v and w is nonempty.
This distribution approach maintains the condition that no two elements from the
cells of v and w coexist within the same cell of u.
      Ultimately, through this step-by-step procedure, we effectively generate a com-
mon neighbor u for the vertices v and w, with each cell of u intersecting nontrivially
with each cell of v and w.

Remark 4.1.1. In this text, we primarily  )︁ focus on complete bipartite subgraphs, as
the definition of simplices in Bedge P(3 ) depends on these. To construct a complete
                                    (︁  3

bipartite subgraph, we start with a subset of vertices S in a graph G. We identify the

common neighbours of these common neighbours, CN CN(S) . This process yields

where | CN CN(a, b) | = i and | CN(a, b)| = j.
          (︁       )︁

     In the following proposition, we prove the complete bipartite subgraphs we con-
structed in this remark, are maximal.

Proposition 4.1.2. The complete bipartite subgraphs build using the method of
Remark 4.1.1 are maximal.

Proof:       Suppose (A, B) is one of the subgraphs constructed by the method of
the mentioned remark, and it is not maximal, with A being the left side and B the
right side. This would imply there is a vertex v that could be added to one side, say
A, such that v connects with all vertices in B, thereby maintaining the property of
a complete bipartite subgraph. Thus, the common neighbours of the vertices of B
would be A ∪ {v}.
     However, this would contradict the construction process of (A, B) which says the
common neighbours of vertices of B are exactly the vertices in A, and vice versa.
Therefore, no additional vertex can be added to (A, B) without disrupting this estab-
lished relationship, meaning (A, B) must be a maximal complete bipartite subgraph.



Proposition 4.1.3. Assume we have a, b ∈ V (P(33 )) such that(︁ T(a, b) = i where i =)︁
5, 6, 7, 9, and let G be the maximal complete bipartite subgraph CN(CN(a, b)), CN(a, b)
originating from the vertex pair a, b by applying the method of Remark 4.1.1 on this
pair. Then for any pair of type i in CN(CN(a, b)), using this method yields the same
bipartite subgraph G.

Proof:      Consider a pair {s, t} ⊆ CN(CN(a, b)) with T(s, t) = i. If we take
common neighbours of both sides of the inclusion, this reverses the inclusion, yield-
ing CN(a, b) ⊆ CN(s, t). Since pairs a, b and s, t are of the same type, they have
an equal number of common neighbours, resulting in CN(a, b) = CN(s, t). Con-
sequently, CN(CN(a, b)) = CN(CN(s, t)). Therefore, the maximal complete bipar-
(︁ subgraph we get by)︁ applying the method from Remark 4.1.1 on the pair s, t is
tite
  CN(CN(s, t)), CN(s, t) , which matches G.


     Now we apply the method of Remark 4.1.1 to the vertex pairs of different equiv-
alent classes to construct maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ).

Constructing K2,2
Consider the following vertices v and w of type 9. Next, we explore the common
neighbours of these two vertices which is visualized in the diagram of Figure 4.1:
                                        123         147
                                        456         258
                                                                                     (4.1.1)

                                          v           w
     First, we distribute the elements of the initial cell of v, namely {1, 2, 3}, into
separate cells of u. The distribution of the subsequent cell, {4, 5, 6}, of v into cells
of u depends on the relative positioning of these elements in w. The elements 4, 5,
and 6 must be positioned in such a way that they do not co-occur with elements 1,
2, and 3, respectively, within the same cell of u. This constraint leaves us with only
two viable arrangements, illustrated in the second row of diagram 4.1.

    Figure 4.1: Constructing the common neighbours of a pair of vertices of type
    9

     Next, we place the elements of the cell {7, 8, 9} into the cells of u. The arrange-
ment of these elements within w dictates that they must not co-occur within the same
cell of u with the pairs {1, 4}, {2, 5}, and {3, 6}, respectively. Once the distribution
of the second cell of v, {4, 5, 6}, within cells of u is set, there exists a single valid way
to place these elements in the cells of u, as depicted in the final row of the diagram.
     Considering v and w as type-9 vertices, they are adjacent and share two common
neighbors. This relationship forms a K2,2 bipartite graph. In this context, K2,2
represents the structure consisting of a pair of type-9 vertices, their shared neighbors,
and the edges connecting the vertices with these common neighbors.
     We further note that the shared neighbors of v and w are also adjacent. This
observation culminates in the following two lemmas:

Lemma 4.1.4. Let A and B be two disjoint sets of vertices of size two, with every
vertex in A adjacent to every vertex in B. If A contains a type-9 pair of vertices, then
the bipartite graph K2,2 is a complete graph K4 .

Lemma 4.1.5. Each bipartite graph K2,2 is included in a 4-clique.

    These lemmas shed light on the structural relationship between a K2,2 bipartite
graph and a 4-clique.

Constructing K2,12
We now construct a bipartite graph K2,12 starting from vertices v and w of type 5.
Consider the two familiar vertices of type 5 with their grid pattern as below:

               123 123                                        123
               456 457                                               45 6
               789 896                                               7 89
                v   w                              The grid pattern of v and w of type 5

                      Table 4.1: An example of a pair of type 5

     The process begins by distributing the common cell {1, 2, 3} of v and w into
separate cells of their common neighbour u, one element in each cell.
     Due to the shared pairs {5, 6} and {8, 9} between v and w, the elements of each
pair must be distributed into distinct cells. One possible distribution include ??,
which prevents elements 4 and 7 from co-occurring with elements from the shared
pairs in the same cell of u.
     Further, the elements of the shared pairs can be allocated to the cells of u in
two ways: pairing 5 with 8, and 6 with 9, or pairing 5 with 9, and 6 with 8. With
3! ways to place the pairs {5, 8}, {6, 9}, and {4, 7} adjacent to 1, 2, and 3, a total of
2 × 3! = 12 different configurations can generate a common neighbor of v and w of
type 5.
     Given the knowledge from section 2.2 that each vertex of the graph P(33 ) is
included in 12 different 4-cliques and thus is adjacent to all vertices of 12 triangles as
depicted in Figure 4.2, we can assert that the 12 common neighbors of v and w are a
subset of vertices of 12 triangles adjacent to v.




           Figure 4.2: A vertex is adjacent to all the vertices of a triangle
                     (︁     )︁
4. CONSTRUCTING BEDGE P(33 )                                                                76


     Notably, when v and w are of type 5 and hence not adjacent, vertex w is adjacent
to just one vertex from each triangle. If vertex w were adjacent to two vertices from
the same triangle, according to Lemma 4.1.4, it would form a K4 graph with v and
the two triangle vertices, contradicting the non-adjacency of v and w. Therefore, two
type 5 vertices generate a K2,12 complete bipartite graph (look at Figure 4.3).




      Figure 4.3: Common neighbours of v and w of type 5 leading to a K2,12

    We can determine three common neighbours of v and w utilizing the methodology
described earlier in this chapter. Consider the following common neighbours of v and
w:

         a = {{1, 4, 8}, {2, 6, 7}, {3, 5, 9}}, b = {{1, 4, 9}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 7}}
                          c = {{1, 6, 7}, {2,4, 8}, {3, 5, 9}}

Upon investigating the common neighbours of vertices a, b, and c, we commence by
distributing the first cell of a, i.e., {1, 4, 8}, among the three cells of a candidate
common neighbour, denoted as u. To this end, we assign each of the elements 1, 4,
and 8 to a separate cell in u, leading to an intermediate configuration of the form
u = {{1, ., .}, {4, ., .}, {8, ., .}}.
     Subsequently, we turn our attention to the second cell of a, {2, 6, 7}. Observ-
ing that the triplet {2, 4, 8} forms a cell in vertex c, we deduce that element 2
cannot co-occur with elements 4 and 8 in the same cell of u. Hence, element 2
is allocated to the cell currently including element 1, leading to the updated form
u = {{1, 2, .}, {4, ., .}, {8, ., .}}.
     For elements 6 and 7, our previous deduction implies that they can be assigned
to the cells of elements 4 or 8 in u. This situation produces two viable configurations,
namely:

        u1 = {{1, 2, .}, {4, 6, .}, {8, 7, .}},   u2 = {{1, 2, .}, {4, 7, .}, {8, 6, .}}.

Lastly, we wish to distribute the third cell of a, {3, 5, 9}, among the cells of both u1
and u2 . Given that {3, 6, 7} constitutes a cell in vertex b, element 3 cannot coexist
with elements 6 and 7 within the same cell of u. Hence, the only suitable cell for
element 3 is the one already containing 1 and 2. Furthermore, considering that both
{2, 5, 8} and {1, 4, 9} are cells in vertex b, we can infer that element 5 cannot share a
cell with element 8 and element 9 cannot share a cell with element 4. Consequently,
the only feasible configurations for the common neighbours of a, b, c are:

         u1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 6, 5}, {8, 7, 9}}u2 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 7, 5}, {8, 6, 9}}

which are equal to the vertices v and w. Consequently, according to Lemma 1.2.3, we
find that v and w are indeed the only common neighbours of all of their 12 common
neighbours.

Constructing K6,4
To find the common neighbours of vertices v and w, as depicted in Table 4.2, we apply
a similar methodology to those used earlier. This method is summarized briefly in
diagram 4.4, with detailed steps provided below. The process starts, as usual, with

               123 124                                             12 3

                     Table 4.2: An example of a type-6 vertex pair

distributing the elements of the first cell of v, i.e., {1, 2, 3}, into three different cells
of a new candidate vertex u, leading to an intermediate configuration of u of the form
u = {{1, ., .}, {2, ., .}, {3, ., .}}.
     Next, we seek to distribute the elements of the second cell of v, namely {4, 5, 6}.
In doing this, it is necessary to adhere to the condition that element 4 cannot be
placed in the same cell as 1 and 2, since it is included in the same cell {1, 2, 4} of w
as these elements. Also, element 7 from the last cell of v cannot be placed with 5
and 6 due to its occurrence in the cell {5, 6, 7} of vertex w. Hence, there is only one
remaining spot for element 7. After distributing elements 4, 5, and 6 in compliance
with these constraints, we arrive at the intermediate configurations depicted in step
2 of diagram 4.4.
     In the final step, we distribute the elements 8 and 9 of the third cell of v into the
remaining slots of the cells in u. Given the constraints already imposed, the place-
ments of 8 and 9 in this step are not restricted, allowing for four viable configurations
of u, which are all valid common neighbours of v and w.

             Figure 4.4: Common neighbours of a type-6 pair of vertices


     To find the maximal complete bipartite subgraph derived from a type-6 pair
v and w, we examine CN(CN(v, w)). We start by considering one of the common
neighbours of v and w, m. We distribute the elements of the first cell of m, {1, 6, 8},
across the cells of a new vertex u.
     Next, we aim to distribute the elements of the second cell of m, i.e., {2, 5, 9}.
Given that {2, 6, 8} is a cell of another common neighbour q of v and w, and {1, 5, 8}
is a cell of yet another common neighbour p of v and w, we face the constraints that
element 2 cannot be in the same cell as elements 6 and 8, and element 5 cannot be
in the same cell as elements 1 and 8. Then, there is only one spot that element 9 can
be placed in, and thus, u = {{1, 2, .}, {6, 5, .}, {8, 9, .}}.
     Finally, the elements of the third cell of m, i.e., {3, 4, 7}, can be placed in the
remaining spots of u in any order due to the lack of any additional constraints. This
implies that there are 3! = 6 valid configurations for u, and hence | CN(CN(v, w))| =
6. Consequently, we have constructed a maximal complete bipartite subgraph K6,4
derived from a pair of vertices of type 6 in P(33 ).
     As we explore the common neighbours, it becomes critical to categorize the
vertex pairs on each side of the K6,4 subgraph. This classification is integral to
subsequent chapters; for instance, it(︁is employed      in Section 4.2.1, where we analyze
the intersections of simplices of Bedge P(3 ) . These simplices, in essence, correspond
                                            3
                                               )︁

to these bipartite subgraphs.
     The vertex pairs comprising the 6 common neighbours of v and w display distinct
grid patterns. Leveraging these patterns, we can seamlessly compute each pair’s
relationship type, as illustrated in Figure 4.5.The types of vertex pairs are indicated
on the curves connecting them, which should not be mistaken for edges. Given that
this is a complete bipartite subgraph, all vertices on the left side are adjacent to those
on the right.

     All left-side pairs in a K6,4 are either type 5 or 6, producing triples of type 5,5,6
or 6,6,6. On the right side, pairs and resulting triples are all of type 5. These findings
can be cross-verified later with Table 4.4, where we list all non-equivalent vertex
triples, classifying them by type, and identify the bipartite subgraphs they belong to.

Consider the vertices of type 7 in Table 4.3:

               123 124                                          12 3

                    Table 4.3: An example of a type-7 vertex pair

      The methodology previously described allows us to identify the common neigh-
bours of v and w, as depicted in diagram 4.4. Subsequently, diagram 4.7 showcases
the common neighbours of b and c which are two mutual neighbours of v and w.
      It is clear that two common neighbours of b and c are indeed v and w, but there
are also two additional common neighbours e and f . A simple verification shows that
these neighbours, e and f , are also adjacent to a and d. Consequently, CN(CN(v, w))
consists of the vertices e, f, v, and w. Hence, a pair of type 7 vertices generates the
maximal complete bipartite subgraph K4,4 .
      For a more in-depth understanding of the K4,4 subgraph structure, we examine
the vertex pair types on each side of the subgraph, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. This
provides a clearer view of the internal arrangements within this bipartite configura-
tion.

     In Figure 4.8, it is noticeable that all vertex pairs in a K4,4 are of either type 5 or
7, and all triples conform to the type 5,5,7. Notably, the two sides of this subgraph
are symmetric regarding the pairs’ type. Any pair of type 7 within this subgraph can
be used as a starting point to construct this exact subgraph. Further corroboration
is provided later in Table 4.4, confirming that the only triple included in a K4,4 is of
the type 5,5,7.

Properties and Notations of Bipartite Subgraphs
In graph theory, the left-right designation of the sides of a bipartite graph is typically
inconsequential. However, in the context of simplices in Bedge , which are subsets
of edge sets of complete bipartite subgraphs in P(33 ) (recall definition 1.3.1), this
order becomes crucial due to edge orientation. At times, we discuss the antipodal of
a bipartite subgraph Ki,j . Essentially, it remains the same subgraph; however, the
sides are interchanged, hence it is denoted as Kj,i .
       Throughout this document, any references made to the subgraphs K1,36 , K2,2 ,
K2,12 , K4,4 , or K6,4 pertain to the respective subgraphs we established earlier in
this section. Proposition 4.1.2 confirms that these bipartite subgraphs, are indeed
maximal. Furthermore, Theorem 4.1.14 certifies that          )︁ constitute the entire set
                                                           these
of maximal complete bipartite subgraphs in Bedge P(3 ) .
                                                       (︁  3

       When the specific pair a, b that generates the bipartite subgraph Ki,j (a, b) is of
relevance, we use the notation Ki,j (a, b). If the pair is insignificant, we simply write
Ki,j .
       The only maximal complete bipartite subgraph that does not originate from a
pair of vertices is K1,36 , comprising of a single vertex w on one side, all its neighbours
on the other, and the edges connecting the left side to the right. We denote this as
K1,36 (w) = (w, CN(w)).

     On the right side of a K1,36 , pairs and triples of vertices of any type may appear,
excluding triples of types 5,5,9 and 5,6,9 due to their non-existence as dictated later
by Lemma 3.2.1. Types 5,6,6 and 6,6,7 are also excluded, as per Table 4.4, due to
their lack of common neighbours.

Proposition 4.1.6. The set of bipartite subgraphs built from a vertex pair of type
i, with i ∈ {5, 6, 7, 9} by the process explained in Remark 4.1.1 are equivalent.

Proof:     In constructing the bipartite subgraphs from a type i pair, we select all
the common neighbours of the pair, then determine all their common neighbours in
turn. This procedure’s sole variable is the pair type. As per Theorem 3.1.4, pairs of
the same type are equivalent. Hence, the set of all bipartite subgraphs constructed
from one type of vertex pair are equivalent.


    A direct outcome of Lemma 4.1.4 and Lemma 4.1.2 is the following:

Proposition 4.1.7. The subgraphs K2,12 , K4,4 , and K6,4 are induced subgraphs.

Proof:      Assume, by way of contradiction, that Ki,j is one of the above subgraphs
and is not induced. This implies the existence of an edge e in the graph that does
not belong to the subgraph Ki,j . Given that Ki,j is a complete bipartite subgraph,
the extraneous edge e must connect two vertices, say v and v ′ , each of them on the
same side of Ki,j . Since Ki,j is a complete bipartite graph, both v and v ′ are adjacent
to every vertex on the opposite side of the bipartite graph. By Lemma 4.1.4, this
leads to the existence of a complete bipartite graph K2,2 within Ki,j , which contains
the vertices v, v ′ , and two vertices from the opposite side. However, this is in contra-
diction with Lemma 4.1.4, which states that every K2,2 is maximal. Thus, it follows
that our initial assumption is false, and Ki,j must indeed be an induced subgraph.




4.1.2     Inclusion of Vertex Triples and Quadruples in Bipartite
          Subgraphs
In this section, we focus on vertex triples and quadruples belonging to different equiv-
alence classes and aim to identify their common neighbours.        Our objective is to
demonstrate that the complete bipartite subgraphs, CN(CN(triple)), CN(triple) ,
                                                        (︁                            )︁

obtained through the same process used for vertex pairs in Remark 4.1.1, are encom-
passed within the known complete bipartite subgraphs.

Inclusion of Vertex Triples
In this section, we revisit Section 3.2.2, where we identified the equivalence classes
into which vertex triples of specific types are divided. Utilizing these results, we will
analyze each class to determine the common neighbours of the vertex triples.
     Table 4.4 serves as a comprehensive version of Table 3.13 which classified all the
vertex triples of different types. Table 4.4 includes not only the number of common
neighbours for each triple class but also the maximal complete bipartite subgraph
that is formed by applying the method of Remark 4.1.1 to the triple. The way these
subgraphs are constructed guarantees their uniqueness.
     After presenting this table, we will employ the familiar method detailed in Section
4.1.1 to determine the common neighbours of a triple of type 5,5,5. We also illustrate
the maximal complete bipartite subgraph, in which this triple is included in.
     Similar to the process for a triple of type 5,5,5 as described in Lemma 4.1.8,
we can apply this approach to each class of vertex triples discussed in Appendix
A. This methodology allows us to initially identify the common neighbours and the
corresponding maximal complete bipartite subgraph.
     While this analysis is relatively straightforward, it is also quite lengthy. As such,
we believe it is not essential to include it in this text. Instead, we have provided

the results of this analysis in Table 4.4, which provides sufficient information for our
subsequent discussions.

Lemma 4.1.8. A triple of type 5,5,5 either shares six neighbours and the bipartite
subgraph derived from it using the method of Remark 4.1.1 is consequently a K4,6 ,
or it does not share any neighbours.

Proof:     Refer back to Lemma 3.2.3, where triples of type 5,5,5 are classified into
two classes - first kind and second kind. Consider the first kind triple we computed
in this lemma as follows:
                                 123     123    123

We use the same algorithm introduced in Section 4.1.1 to find the common neighbours
of a group of vertices. The algorithm to find the common neighbours of the triple
v, w, u1 can be found in the diagram of Figure 4.9. The details of this analysis are

          Figure 4.9: Common neighbours of a first kind triple of type 5,5,5

given subsequently. Let z be the common neighbour of the triple v, w, u1 . Initially,
we distribute the shared cell of v, w, and u1 across the three cells of z (the first step
of the diagram).
     The elements of each shared pair of v and w, {5, 6} and {8, 9}, cannot be together
in a cell of z. Since 5 and 9 are together in one cell of u1 they cannot be in the same
cell of their common neighbour; for the same reason, 8 and 6 cannot be in the same
cell of z. Thus, there are six ways to place the pairs {5, 8} and {6, 9} in the cells of
z (second step of the diagram).
     In the diagram, after we arrange the vertex z in the second step, only two empty
spots remain. These are the only available spaces for the remaining elements, 4 and
7. We can place them in these two spots without violating any rules. This is because
neither of these elements co-exist with the elements 1, 2, or 3 in any of the cells
belonging to the vertices of the triple v, w, u1 . This arrangement is validated by the
third step of the diagram.
     Therefore, vertices of the first kind of the 5,5,5 have 6 common neighbours,
| CN(v, w, u1 )| = 6.
     Consider two of the common neighbours of v, w, u1 which are denoted as z and
z in the diagram. Since z and z ′ are adjacent to all the vertices of the triple v, w, u1 ,
  ′

we have {v, w, u1 } ⊆ CN(z, z ′ ). By taking the common neighbours of both sides of
the inclusion, we deduce that

                               CN(CN(z, z ′ )) ⊆ CN(v, w, u1 ).

which holds by Lemma 1.2.3.
     It is easy to verify that the type of z and z ′ , denoted T(z, z ′ ), equals 6. Refer-
encing Figure 4.5, we know | CN(z, z ′ )| = 4 and | CN(CN(z, z ′ ))| = 6, and

    Taking into account our earlier result that | CN(v, w, u1 )| = 6, we find that
| CN(CN(z, z ′ ))| = | CN(v, w, u1 )|. This equality implies that

    CN(CN(z, z ′ )) = CN(v, w, u1 )
    ⇒ CN CN(CN(z, z ′ )) = CN(CN(v, w, u1 ))                 Taking CN of both sides
           (︁                )︁

    ⇒ CN(z, z ′ ) = CN(CN(v, w, u1 )).                       By Lemma 1.2.4

    which means the complete bipartite subgraph constructed by this triple by the
method of Remark 4.1.1 forms a K4,6 subgraph:
                    (︁                                )︁
                      CN(CN(v, w, u1 )), CN(v, w, u1 ) = K4,6 .

Now, consider the triple v, w, u2 of the second kind of type 5,5,5 we computed in
Lemma 3.2.3 as the following:

                                   123      123     123
                                   456      489     467
                                   789      756     589
                                     v        w      u2

     The elements in a cell of each v, w, and u2 are distributed across three distinct
cells of their common neighbour. Therefore, element 7 cannot be placed in the same
cell as 8, 9, 5, 6, or 4. Also, since {4, 5, 6} forms a cell of v, each element of this cell
is placed in a different cell of the shared neighbour, leaving no room for element 7.
Thus, second-kind triples of type 5,5,5 do not share any neighbours.

In this section, our objective is to establish that if we extract the common neighbours
of a vertex quadruple and subsequently find the common neighbours of these initial
common neighbours (the method of Remark 4.1.1), the resulting subgraph forms one
of the known maximal complete bipartite subgraphs.
     Before commencing the analysis for this section, we need the following lemma.

Lemma 4.1.9. If all the pairs of the vertices of the vertex set V ⊆ V (P(33 )) are of
type 5, then they share a cell.

Proof:       Suppose that v = {v1 , v2 , v3 } and w = {w1 , w2 , w3 } are two arbitrary
vertices in V , with vi and wi denoting their respective cells for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Given

4. CONSTRUCTING BEDGE P(33 )                                                          86


that T(v, w) = 5, by reference to the grid pattern for type 5 pairs in 3.3, we deduce
that v and w share a common cell.
      Without loss of generality, assume that v1 = w1 is their common cell. Then for
all i, j ∈ {2, 3}, vi ∩ wj ̸= ∅.
      Consider another vertex u ∈ V . Since T(u, v) = T(u, w) = 5, vertex u shares a
common cell with both v and a common cell with w. This common cell must be v1
(which is equal to w1 ) because:

  1. Consider a situation where the common cell of u with v (or w) is different from
     v1 , and yet u shares a common cell with w (res. v) which is w1 . In this case, u
     would share two common cells with v (res. w). However, this would imply that
     u = v (res. u = w), contradicting our initial assumption that all vertices in the
     set V are distinct.

  2. If u shares a common cell with v and w that is different from v1 , then the
     common cell of u with v is vi and the common cell of u with w is wj for
     i, j = 2 or 3. This contradicts the property that the cells of a vertex are disjoint
     sets, as we have vi ∩ wj ̸= ∅.

Hence, the common cell of u with both w and v is indeed v1 which is their common
cell.


     Utilizing Table 4.4, we can infer if a vertex quadruple contains some special vertex
triple, then the maximal complete bipartite subgraph derived from the quadruple by
applying the method of Remark 4.1.1 to the quadruple, is one of the following forms:

   • If there exists a triple of type 5,6,6 or 6,6,7 in the quadruple, then the quadruple
     does not share any common neighbours, and thus does not lead to a bipartite
     subgraph.

   • If there exists a triple of type 7,7,7 in the quadruple, then the quadruple either
     does not share any common neighbours, or its corresponding maximal complete
     bipartite subgraph forms a K1,36 .

   • If the triple type is 5,7,7; 6,7,7; or 5,6,7, then the quadruple corresponds to one
     of the following scenarios:

        1. It does not share any neighbours.
        2. It shares one neighbour and leads to a K1,36 subgraph.
        3. It shares the same two common neighbours as the triple. We know the
           maximal complete bipartite subgraph corresponding to the triple is a K2,12 .
           Let K2,12 = (A, B), where |A| = 2 and |B| = 12. Then the quadruple is
                     (︁     )︁
4. CONSTRUCTING BEDGE P(33 )                                                         87


           a subset of CN(A) and we know that CN(A) = B. Hence, the quadruple
           forms a subset of B. Consequently, in this case, the maximal complete
           bipartite subgraph derived from the quadruple forms a K2,12 .

     Given these observations, we only need to analyze quadruples that do not contain
any triples of the aforementioned types. The remaining types to consider are 5,5,5;
5,5,6; 5,5,7; and 6,6,6. In Table 4.5, we will demonstrate that quadruples formed by
these triples are contained within either a K6,4 or K4,4 subgraph.
     Consider a vertex quadruple v, w, u, p in P(33 ). In Table 4.5, the first column
represents the case number, while the other columns, excluding the final one, detail the
possible types of vertex pairs within the quadruple v, w, u, p. The table is organized
into four sections, each section holding constant the types T(u, w), T(v, w), and
T(u, v).
     The last column, labelled “bipartite subgraph”, contains the outcomes for each
case, which are subsequently proven. In this column, the symbol “ × ” denotes
the absence of a quadruple with the specified types. Conversely, “ Ki,j ” implies
that applying the method of Remark 4.1.1 to the given quadruple results in a Ki,j
subgraph.

    Table 4.5: Inclusion of quadruples with the triples of types 5,5,5 or 5,5,6 or
    5,5,7 or 6,6,6 in the known bipartite subgraphs

     Having already classified vertex triples into various types, our current approach
involves selecting a triple from a specific equivalence class and then scrutinizing all
potential candidates for the fourth vertex. As an illustration, we will prove the first
case in Table 4.5, which asserts that no maximal complete bipartite subgraph can
originate from a quadruple with the pair types stated in this case. The succeeding
cases listed in this table are substantiated in a similar manner and are detailed in
Appendix B.

4. CONSTRUCTING BEDGE P(33 )                                                         88


Lemma 4.1.10. Given a vertex triple u, v, w of type 5,5,6, the application of the
method specified in Remark 4.1.1 to any vertex quadruple incorporating this triple
will either yield no bipartite subgraph or will generate a K6,4 bipartite subgraph.

Proof:       By Table 4.4, all triples of type 5,5,6 are equivalent. Consider the triple
v, w, u of this type as the following:

                                 123       124      123
                                 456       389      567
                                                                                 (4.1.4)
                                 789       567      489
                                   v         w        u

The common neighbours of the triple v, w, u are the same as the common neighbours
of v and w presented in the diagram of Figure 4.4. So, | CN(v, w, u)| = 4. From Table
4.4, we see the complete bipartite subgraph derived from a triple of type 5,5,6 is a
K6,4 :
                                                                               (4.1.5)
                       (︁                             )︁
                          CN(CN(v, w, u)), CN(v, w, u) = K6,4 .
Here, we study cases number 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Table 4.5:

  1. Since T(p, v) = 5, we need to choose a common cell between these two vertices.
     The common cell cannot be {1, 2, 3} because it would make a common cell with
     u which contradicts T(p, u) = 7. If the common cell is {4, 5, 6} or {7, 8, 9}, then
     the common cell with w has to be {3, 8, 9} or {1, 2, 4} respectively, due to the
     fact that they are the only cells of w disjoint from the corresponding cells in v.
     Then no cell of v would share one element with each cell of u which contradicts
     T(p, u) = 7. Therefore, there is no quadruple of the types of the first case.

  2. Since T(p, v) = 5, we need to choose a cell shared between p and v. This cell
     cannot be {1, 2, 3} because it contradicts T(p, u) = 6. If the cell is {4, 5, 6}
     or {7, 8, 9}, then the common cell of p and w would be {3, 8, 9} or {1, 2, 4},
     respectively. Then the last cell of p is formed with the remaining elements.
     Therefore, the fourth vertex p can take on two potential configurations, denoted
     as p1 and p2 :

                             p1 = {{4, 5, 6}, {3, 8, 9}, {1, 2, 7}}
                             p2 = {{7, 8, 9}, {1, 2, 4}, {3, 5, 6}}.

     Upon further examination, we see p1 and p2 are adjacent to all the com-
     mon neighbours of the triple v, w, u presented in the diagram of Figure 4.4.
     This implies that {v, w, u, p} ⊆ CN(CN(v, w, u)). After taking the common
     neighbours of both sides, the direction of the inclusion is reversed, then by
     Lemma 1.2.4, the inclusion CN(v, w, u) ⊆ CN(v, w, u, p) holds. Moreover,

4. CONSTRUCTING BEDGE P(33 )                                                        89


     since we have the set inclusion {v, w, u} ⊆ {v, w, u, p}, taking the common
     neighbours of both sides gives CN({v, w, u, p}) ⊆ CN(v, w, u). This results
     in CN(v, w, u, p) = CN(v, w, u); and taking common neighbours of both sides
     confirms that CN(CN(v, w, u, p)) = CN(CN(v, w, u)). Therefore, by equation
     (4.1.5) the complete bipartite subgraph derived by applying the method of Re-
     mark 4.1.1 to the quadruple v, w, u, p forms a K6,4 :
                       (︁                                   )︁
                          CN(CN(v, w, u, p)), CN(v, w, u, p) = K6,4 .

  3. Since the triple v, u, p is of type 5,5,5, they share a common cell. By Lemma
     4.1.9, the common cell is {1, 2, 3} because it is the common cell of v and u.
     Similarly, the triple w, u, p is of type 5,5,5, so the vertices must share a cell.
     The cell is {5, 6, 7} as it is the common cell of w and u. Then the last cell of
     p is formed with the remaining elements {4, 8, 9}. However, this choice of cells
     makes two vertices p and w equal. Consequently, there is no distinct vertex
     that satisfies the conditions of case number 3.
  4. Since T(p, u) = 5, they share a cell. This cell cannot be {1, 2, 3} or {5, 6, 7}
     as it contradicts T(p, v) = 6 and T(p, w) = 6, respectively. Consequently, one
     cell of p is {4, 8, 9}. To follow T(p, w) = 6, the choices for the next cell of p
     are {3, 6, 7}, {3, 5, 7}, and {3, 5, 6}. However, the two first ones are not valid
     because they contradict T(p, v) = 6. Therefore, the only option for p is:
                             p = {{4, 8, 9}, {3, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 7}}.
     It can be easily verified that p is adjacent to all the common neighbours of
     the triple v, w, u presented in the diagram of Figure 4.5. Thus, {v, w, u, p} ⊆
     CN(CN(v, w, u)). Then similar to case number 2, we see the complete bipartite
     subgraph derived from the quadruple v, w, u, p is a K6,4 .




4.1.3    Main Theorem of Bipartite Subgraphs
In this subsection, we present Theorem 4.1.14, which stands as a pivotal result of
                                                                       (︁ subgraphs

of P(33 ), thereby facilitating the construction of simplices in Bedge P(33 ) . The

foundation of this theorem relies on our accumulated understanding of the maximal
complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ), as well as the equivalencies related to vertex
pairs, triples, and quadruples, and their respective inclusion in bipartite subgraphs.
To fully develop this theorem, we will introduce some supporting lemmas in the
following.

4. CONSTRUCTING BEDGE P(33 )                                                               90


Lemma 4.1.11. Let V = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vt |t ≥ 2} be a set of distinct vertices of P(33 )
such that each pair of vertices in V has 5 or more common neighbours. Then every
pair of vertices in V is of type 5.
Proof:         Assume by contradiction that there exist vertices v, v ′ ∈ V such that
T(v, v ′ ) ̸= 5, but rather T(v, v ′ ) ∈ {6, 7, 9}. In this case, the number of common
neighbours of v and v ′ , and consequently of all vertices in V , would be less than or
equal to 4, contradicting the assumption that each pair of vertices in V has 5 or more
common neighbours.

The following corollary is directly resulted from the Lemmas 4.1.11 and 4.1.9:
Corollary 4.1.12. Let V = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vk } be a set of distinct vertices of P(33 ) with
k ≥ 2, such that each pair of vertices in V has 5 or more common neighbours. Then,
all vertices in V share a common cell.
Lemma 4.1.13. The largest set S ⊆ V (P(33 )) such that every triple of vertices in
S belongs to the first kind of type 5,5,5 consists of 4 vertices.
Proof:       As indicated by Lemma 4.1.9, all vertices of set S share a common cell.
Looking at the grid pattern for a pair of type 5 (as demonstrated in 3.3), it is clear
that creating a pair of vertices of type 5 requires a common cell and two distinct pairs
of elements, each from a non-shared cell. Furthermore, the cube pattern of a triple of
the first kind of type 5,5,5 (shown in Table 3.15) does not share any pair of elements
across the three vertices. This leads us to focus on pairs of vertices of type 5 which
share unique pairs of elements.
     Now, consider a vertex v with cell structure denoted as {v1 , v2 , v3 }. Suppose v1 is
the common cell between v and a new vertex w. Our goal is to determine the number
of potential vertices w such that the pair v, w is of type 5. The cell v2 must share
two elements with one of w’s cells. However, we are specifically interested in vertices
w that share unique pairs of elements with v’s cells.
     Given that |v2 | = 3, it comprises three distinct pairs of elements. Consequently,
we can generate at most three different vertices w each of type 5 with v. Therefore,
we end up with a total of 4 vertices: v and the three vertices w. Since all these
vertices share a cell, all pairs among them are of type 5. Furthermore, by uniquely
choosing the shared pairs, all triples among these vertices belong to the first kind of
type 5,5,5.


In the following theorem, we show all the complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ) are
of one of the forms K1,36 , K2,12 , K2,2 , K4,4 , or K6,4 .
Theorem 4.1.14. Let (M, N ) = Km,n be a complete bipartite subgraph of P(33 ),
where M, N ̸= ∅. The subgraph (M, N ) is included in or equal to a K1,36 , K2,12 , K2,2 ,
K4,4 , or K6,4 .

Proof:      The proof is done by a case study on the side N of the subgraph (M, N ),
which equivalently can be done on M too.
     Case 1: 37 ≤ n. As each vertex has a degree of 36, this case is not possible.
     Case 2: 13 ≤ n ≤ 36. Earlier in Section 4.1.1 we proved the largest number of
the common neighbours of a vertex pair is 12. Then, in this case, M contains just
one vertex, and thus, (M, N ) is a subgraph of a K1,36 .
     Case 3: 5 ≤ n ≤ 12. By Lemma 4.1.11 all the vertex pairs of M are of type 5.
Since n ≥ 5, triples of M are of the first kind of type 5,5,5. Now we study the cases
of the side M :

   • m = 1: (M, N ) is included in a K1,36 .

   • m = 2: From subsection 4.1.1, we know that the maximal complete bipartite
     graph derived from a pair of type 5 is a K2,12 . So, (M, N ) is a subgraph of
     K2,12 .

   • m = 3: Since the triple in M is of the first kind of type 5,5,5, then based on
     the Table 4.4, (M, N ) is a subgraph of a K6,4 .

   • m = 4: We know from Table 4.5 that a set of four vertices, where all pairs are
     of type 5, is a subgraph of K6,4 .

   • m ≥ 5 : By Lemma 4.1.13, no set of vertices of size 5 or more exists where all
     the triples are of the first kind of type 5,5,5.

Case 4: 2 ≤ n ≤ 4. Again we break it down to the following cases of M :

   • m = 2: By our earlier categorization of pairs, (M, N ) is a subgraph of (or equal
     to) one of: K2,2 , K2,12 , K4,6 , or K4,4 .

   • m = 3: If one of the pair types of M was 9, then (M, N ) is a subgraph of K2,2 .
     However, K2,2 is maximal, so there is no pair of type 9 in M . Then all the pair
     types in M are 5, 6, or 7. The pairs of M cannot be all of type 5 because they
     share no common neighbours or 6 common neighbours, and here 0 ̸= n ≤ 4.
     The rows 2 to 10 of Table 4.4 show the subgraph (M, N ) either does not form
     a bipartite subgraph or is a subgraph of a K4,4 , K6,4 , K2,12 , or K1,36 .

   • m = 4: The common neighbours of all four vertices of M are a subset of
     the common neighbours of each triple of M . Similar to the previous case where
     m = 3, we exclude type 9. With the help of Table 4.4 we can make the following
     analysis:

        – If one of the triples is of the type 7,6,6 or 5,6,6, then the vertices of M do
          not share any neighbours.

        – If one of the triples is 6,7,7, or 5,6,7, or 5,7,7, or 7,7,7 we know this triple is
          a subgraph of a K12,2 or K36,1 , or the vertices do not share any neighbours
          (refer to the explanations before Table 4.5).
        – In the Table 4.5 we observe if one of the triples of M is 5,5,5 or 5,5,6 or
          5,5,7 or 6,6,6, then (M, N ) either does not exist, or it is a subgraph of a
          K6,4 or a K4,4 .
   • m ≥ 5: Since vertices of N share a common cell, this case is the same as the
     case where n ≥ 5.
Case 5: n = 1. In this case m ≤ 36 and (M, N ) is a subgraph of a K36,1 .

In this section, we explore the maximal simplices of Bedge P(33 ) , building upon our

understanding of the maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ). In the context
of the edge box complex Bedge (G) as defined in 1.3.1, each complete bipartite subgraph
is associated with a unique simplex, which is in turn constructed uniquely from said
subgraph.
     Building on the results from the previous section, we use the identified maximal
complete bipartite subgraphs (︁of P(3)︁3 ) as a foundation to construct and introduce
the maximal simplices of Bedge P(33 ) . Our exploration does not stop here; we then
venture into the analysis of the intersections of these simplices. The intention is to
understand their structure and interconnections more profoundly, which  (︁ is paramount

     Prior to embarking on our exploration, we need to establish some notations. Re-

simplex Si,j gives rise to a new simplex Sj,i , termed the antipodal of Si,j . Sometimes,
a simplex and its antipodal are generally denoted as S and S,   ˜︁ respectively. Similar
to the maximal complete bipartite subgraphs, the simplices S(︁2,2 , S4,4)︁, S6,4 , S2,12 , S1,36
and their antipodals are the only maximal simplices in Bedge P(33 ) , as articulated
in Corollary 4.2.3.

     The following lemma establishes a natural connection between maximal sim-
plices and maximal complete bipartite subgraphs. This connection serves as a bridge
between these two fundamental components.

Lemma 4.2.2. A simplex in Bedge P(33 ) is maximal if and only if its corresponding

complete bipartite subgraph of P(33 ) is maximal in the set of all complete bipartite
subgraphs of P(33 ).

    Building on (︁Theorem)︁ 4.1.14 and Lemma 4.2.2, we can identify the maximal
simplices in Bedge P(33 ) :

Corollary 4.2.3. The simplices S2,2(︁ , S4,4 ,)︁S6,4 , S2,12 , S1,36 , and their antipodals, are
the only maximal simplices of Bedge P(3 ) .

4.2.1     Intersection of Maximal Simplicies
Now that we know all the maximal simplicies of Bedge P(33 ) , we are able to study
                                                             (︁       )︁

their intersections. The(︁ result)︁of this section will be needed in Section 6.2.4 to reduce
the dimension of Bedge P(33 ) using elementary collapses and discrete Morse func-
tions. The following lemma states that a simplex cannot intersect with both another
simplex and its opposite at the same time.

Lemma 4.2.4. Let A and B be any maximal simplicies of Bedge P(33 ) except the
                                                                          (︁       )︁

S2,2 , with antipodals A        ˜︁ If A ∩ B ̸= ∅, then A ∩ B    ˜︁ = ∅ and A ˜︁ ∩ B = ∅.

Proof:      Revisiting the notations in Remark 4.2.1, let A = A1 ×A2 and B = B1 ×B2 .
Then B = B2 × B1 . Since A ∩ B ̸= ∅, there exist elements x1 ∈ A1 ∩ B1 and
        ˜︁
x2 ∈ A2 ∩B2 . Assume there exists a vertex (y1 , y2 ) ∈ A∩B.˜︁ It follows that y1 ∈ A1 ∩B2
and y2 ∈ A2 ∩ B1 . This implies that {x1 , y2 } ⊆ B1 and {x2 , y1 } ⊆ B2 . As elements
of A1 and A2 are adjacent in P(33 ), x1 and y1 are adjacent to x2 and y2 . However,
according to Proposition 4.1.7, the bipartite subgraph B is induced, leading to a
contradiction. Therefore, it must be that A ∩ B      ˜︁ = ∅ and, by a similar argument,
A˜︁ ∩ B = ∅.

The previous Lemma 4.2.4 does not apply to the simplices A and B being S2,2 , because
this subgraph is not induced. As a result, it is possible for B to intersect both A and
A.

     Next, we turn (︁our attention to the intersections of maximal simplices within the
box complex Bedge P(3 ) . The table in reference 4.6 outlines the maximum size

of intersections between each pair of these simplices. Below, we provide a thorough
explanation of the reasoning behind this table, along with further insights into the
structure of these intersections. In certain instances, the intersection of specific sim-
plices is not explicitly mentioned. This is due to the fact that these intersections are
empty.

Intersection of the 4-clique complex with maximal simplicies:

                  (︁ complex
Although a 4-clique           (recall Figure 2.7 and Definition 2.2.1) is not a maximal
simplex of Bedge P(3 ) , it originates from the maximal clique of the graph P(33 ).
                      3
                        )︁

Therefore, it is important to examine the intersection of this structure with maximal
simplices.
     Consider the following 4-clique, C, and let Cs be the 4-clique complex of Bedge P(33 )
                                                                                    (︁      )︁

corresponding to this 4-clique:

                                     2              3


                                     1              4

                                 Figure 4.10: A 4-clique

     Let i be one of the vertices of Cs , and let S1,36 = {i}×{CN(i)}. Then, Cs ∩S1,36 =
{i} × {CN(i) ∩ C}, which contains all three ordered edges of C connected to vertex
i. Thus, |Cs ∩ S1,36 | = 3. If i is not one of the vertices of the 4-clique C, then
Cs ∩ S1,36 = ∅. The same analysis applies to a S36,1 .
     Let S2,2 = {i, j} × {k, l}, where i, j, k, l are the vertices of the 4-clique C. Since
this S2,2 is a subset of Cs , then S2,2 ∩ Cs = S2,2 and |S2,2 ∩ Cs | = 4, which includes
the ordered edges from i, j to k, l.
     Based on Lemma 2.3.1, we know the 4-clique complexes are disjoint. Moreover,
by Lemma 4.1.5, we know each K2,2 is a subgraph of a 4-clique. Therefore, the only
S2,2 having a non-empty intersection with Cs are the ones included in Cs . There are
three S2,2 that are included in a 4-clique complex along their antipodals.
     Since all the vertices of the 4-clique are adjacent, and the simplices K2,12 , S4,4 ,
and K6,4 are induced subgraphs (recall Proposition 4.1.7), the largest intersection size
of Cs and each of these simplices is one, i.e. their corresponding bipartite subgraphs
intersect at most on an edge.

Intersection of S1,36 with other maximal simplicies:
Let z be a vertex in P(33 ) and
                                    S1,36 = {z} × {CN(z)}
be a maximal simplex of Bedge P(33 ) . If A×B is any maximal simplex of Bedge P(33 ) ,

and z ∈/(︁A ∪ B,)︁ then S1,36 ∩ A × B = ∅. Remember that the vertices of the simplicies
of Bedge P(33 ) are ordered pairs. So, if S1,36 ′
                                                     = {x} × {CN(x)} for a vertex x ∈ P(33 )
and x ̸= z, then S1,36 ∩ S1,36 = ∅; however, if z ∈ CN(x), for the antipodal simplex
                              ′

S36,1 = {CN(x)} × {x}, we have S1,36 ∩ S36,1 = {z} × {x}, and if z ∈         / CN(x), then
S1,36 ∩ S36,1 = ∅.
     Let {ai , bi } ⊆ V (P(33 )) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and
             T(a1 , b1 ) = 5,T(a2 , b2 ) = 6, T(a3 , b3 ) = 7, T(a4 , b4 ) = 9.
Let the following be the Bedge P(33 ) simplicies constructed from these pairs, created

by the method of Remark 4.2.1:

and the antipodals:
                                                                         (︁             )︁
     S12,2 = CN(a1 , b1 ) × CN(CN(a1 , b1 )), S4,6 = CN(a2 , b2 ) × CN CN(a2 , b2 ) .
It should be noted that CN CN(ai , bi ) = {ai , bi } is applicable when i = 1, 4 (refer to
                               (︁         )︁

Section 4.1 for more detail).
     As observed in Section 4.1, the antipodal sets of S2,2 and S4,4 correspond to
another S2,2 and S4,4 , respectively. Therefore, we are not required to investigate the
intersection of simplicial complexes with their antipodal simplex, as it follows the
same structural pattern as the intersection with S2,2 and S4,4 .
     Let(︁ S be any )︁of the above simplicies created by the pair {ai , bi }, i = 1, 2, 3, 4. If
z ∈ CN CN(ai , bi ) , then
                                   S1,36 ∩ S = {z} × CN(ai , bi )
and if z ∈ CN(ai , bi ), then

                                S36,1 ∩ S = {z} × CN CN(ai , bi ) .
The sizes of these intersections are different which depends on the type of the pair
ai , bi :
    |S1,36 ∩ S2,12 | = 12,      |S1,36 ∩ S6,4 | = 4,    |S1,36 ∩ S4,4 | = 4,   |S1,36 ∩ S2,2 | = 2
and for the antipodals:
                             |S1,36 ∩ S12,2 | = 2,     |S1,36 ∩ S4,6 | = 6.

Intersection of S2,2 with other maximal simplicies:
Given that the bipartite subgraphs corresponding to the simplices S2,12 , S6,4 , S4,4 and
their antipodals are induced subgraphs, it follows that S2,2 does not have more than
one vertex in common with them.
     Given that each bipartite subgraph K2,2 is included in exactly one 4-clique (as
shown in Lemma 4.1.5), and given that 4-cliques are edge-distinct (by Proposition
2.1.9), it follows that if two K2,2 are part of two distinct 4-cliques, their corresponding
simplicies S2,2 do not intersect.
     Consider the 4-clique C = {1, 2, 3, 4} in Figure 4.10. Then, the following three
S2,2 simplicies exist within the 4-clique complex of C:

                  {1, 2} × {3, 4},   {1, 3} × {2, 4},   {1, 4} × {2, 3}.

The intersection of each pair of these S2,2 has cardinality one.

Intersection of S2,12 with other maximal simplicies:
The intersection with S1,36 and S2,2 has already been studied in previous cases. Let
S2,12 = {v, w}×CN(v, w) and consider another simplex S2,12

     The intersection of S2,12 with S4,4 is the following:

    Consider p, q ∈ V (P(33 )) such that T(p, q) = 6. We define S6,4
                                                                   ′

    CN(p, q). Referring to Figure 4.5, we can observe that all vertex triples on the
    left side of S6,4 and S6,4
                           ′
                               are of type 5,5,6 while all the triples on the right side
    are of type 5,5,5. Consequently, the left side of these simplices cannot have
    more than a type-5 pair in common with the right side of the other simplex.
    Consider the case where the left sides, CN CN(p, q) and CN CN(c, d) , share
                                                  (︁        )︁        (︁         )︁

    more than a pair of type 5. Then, they must share a pair s, t of type 6, leading
    to the equivalence of the simplices S6,4 and S6,4 ′
                                                        . This equivalence arises from
    the fact that the maximal complete bipartite subgraph derived from any pair of
    type 6 in CN(CN(p, q)) leads to a unique subgraph by Proposition 4.1.3. Hence,
    the left sides cannot share more than a type-5 pair.
    Consider now the case where the right sides, CN(c, d) and CN(p, q), share more
    than a pair of type 5. This implies the existence of a triple of type 5,5,5.
    Referring to Table 4.4, we observe that the maximal complete bipartite subgraph
    built from a triple of type 5,5,5 is a unique K6,4 . Again, this implies equivalence
    of the simplices and thus, the right sides cannot share more than a pair of type
    5.
    Suppose T(x, y) = T(v, w) = 5 and x, y ⊆ CN CN(c, d) ∩ CN CN(p, q) and
                                                         (︁       )︁    (︁        )︁

    v, w ⊆ CN(c, d) ∩ CN(p, q). Hence, the maximum intersection of S6,4 and S6,4      ′

    is given by:
                                   ′
                           S6,4 ∩ S6,4 = {x, y} × {v, w}.
    If {x, y} ⊆ CN CN(c, d) ∩ CN(p, q) and {v, w} ⊆ CN(c, d) ∩ CN CN(p, q) ,
                  (︁       )︁                                    (︁       )︁

    then the maximum intersection of S6,4 and S4,6
                                                ′
                                                   is:
                                       ′
                               S6,4 ∩ S4,6 = {x, y} × {v, w}.
    Therefore, the maximum intersection size is 4:
                                       ′                ′
                              |S6,4 ∩ S6,4 | = |S6,4 ∩ S4,6 | = 4.

  • Intersection of S6,4 with a S4,4 :
    As before consider S4,4 = CN CN(a, b) × CN(a, b) where(︁T(a, b) =)︁7. As shown

    in Figure 4.8, all the vertex triples in CN(a, b) and CN CN(a, b) are of type
    5,5,7. So, the only vertices that S4,4 and S6,4 can share is a pair of type 5 at
    each side.
    Similar to the previous case, the maximum intersection size is 4:


                              |S4,4 ∩ S6,4 | = |S4,4 ∩ S4,6 | = 4

Intersection of a S4,4 with another S′4,4 :
This particular case can be validated in a manner similar to the intersection of two
simplices of the form S6,4 . By referencing Figure 4.8, where all types of the vertex

      In this chapter, we explore two computational approaches for computing the edge
box complex of a graph, Bedge (G). The first approach is a brute-force method that
works on a general graph. This method explores all possible vertex partitions to find
the maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of the graph. The second approach is an
efficient method that leverages the Theorem 4.1.14 to classify the complete bipartite
subgraphs of the graph P(33 ), reducing the time complexity significantly. We present
the algorithms for each approach, analyze their time complexity, and discuss their
advantages and limitations.


5.1     Brute Force Approach
This section presents the algorithm implementing the brute force approach and an-
alyzes its time complexity to understand its performance and efficiency. Although
this method can provide accurate results for small graphs, its practicality for larger
graphs is limited due to its high time complexity. As an illustration, we applied this
algorithm to the Petersen graph and received the correct result on a regular system.

5.1.1    Algorithm
The following brute force algorithm receives the vertices and edges of a graph G, finds
the maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of G, and then builds the simplicies of the
edge box complex of G, Bedge (G).

5.1.2    Complexity
The brute force approach is indeed capable of constructing all the simplices of Bedge P(33 ) ;
                                                                                     (︁     )︁

however, its effectiveness is heavily reliant on time complexity, as well as the size of
the graph.
     As the quantity of vertices and edges in the graph escalates, the number of
potential simplices increases exponentially, posing a significant challenge in processing
and storing this information.

5. COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO COMPUTE BEDGE P(33 )                                 102


     We executed this pseudocode using a SageMath program, which successfully
generated accurate results for small graphs such as the Petersen graph. Nonetheless, it
failed to yield results for the partition graph P(33 ) even when utilizing large computer
clusters with substantial memory and processing time.
     To analyze the time complexity of this pseudocode, we need to consider the
various nested loops and the sizes of the structures created. Let the number of the
vertices be n.

   • The outer loop iterates through all vertices, which is O(n).

   • The next loop generates combinations of vertices. In the worst case, the number
     of combinations is 2n (each vertex can either be in or out of a combination), so
     the complexity is O(2n ).

   • The next loop iterates through half the size of the current combination. In the
     worst case, the combination size is n, so the complexity is O(n/2) = O(n).

   • The next loop iterates through the sub-combinations generated from the current
     combination. In the worst case, the number of sub-combinations is also 2n/2
     (each vertex in the combination can either be in or out of a sub-combination),
     so the complexity is O(2n ).

   • The next loop iterates through all pairs of vertices in left and right, which in
     the worst case is O(n2 ).

   • All the loops of the second nested loop on bipartite subgraphs are O(n). Then
     the nested loop is O(n3 ).

     To determine the overall time complexity of the algorithm, we must consider the
time complexities of the nested loops. The first nested loop has a time complexity of
O(n · 2n · n · 2n · n2 ) = O(n4 · 4n ). Since this is greater than the time complexity of
the second nested loop, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by
the first nested loop, resulting in a time complexity of O(n4 · 4n ).


5.2     An Efficient Approach
The algorithm presented in this section is founded on Theorem 4.1.14, which classifies
all complete bipartite subgraphs of P(33 ) into five distinct classes. Remark 4.1.1 pro-
vides insight into constructing these subgraphs. The efficiency of this approach stems
from its ability to avoid the exhaustive examination of all possible vertex divisions
that generate complete bipartite subgraphs. Successfully implemented in a SageMath
program, this method has been executed on a standard computer, yielding precise
results.

5.2.1    Algorithm
The algorithm 2 constructs the simplicies of the box complex of the graph P(33 ),
given vertex pairs of the graph. This algorithm is self-contained, as it constructs the
vertices of the graph P(33 ) based on its definition and then computes the type of the
vertex pairs.
      The function Type calculates the type of a given pair of vertices. Utilizing this
function, we categorize pairs into their respective types and store them in the lists
type5, type6, type7, and type9. Furthermore, we compile the neighbours of all vertices
in the list Neighbours.
      The function Int_Nb computes the intersection of neighbours for a given list of
vertices, which is essential for the Creat_Simplicies function. This function takes a
list of vertex pairs of a specific type and constructs the corresponding simplicies of
the edge box complex of P(33 ), denoted as Bedge (P(33 ).

5.2.2    Complexity
In this section, we will discuss the improvements in time complexity achieved by the
efficient approach compared to the brute force method. By employing the insights
from Theorem 4.1.14 and Remark 4.1.1, our algorithm has managed      )︁ to significantly
reduce the time complexity required for constructing the Bedge P(33 ) . The following
                                                              (︁

is a detailed analysis, demonstrating the efficiency of this method and its benefits
over the brute force approach.

   • Creating vertices: O(1), as it is a fixed size set.
   • Type function: O(1), as it iterates over a fixed size set (3 elements).
   • Finding pairs of different types: O(n2 ), where n is the number of vertices.
   • Finding neighbors: O(n2 ).
   • Int_Nb function: O(n), as it iterates over a list of vertices.
   • Creat_simplicies function: O(n3 ), as it iterates over pairs and it calls the
     Int_N b function with O(n) complexity.
   • Building simplicies for S1,36 : O(n2 ), as it iterates over vertices and their neigh-
     bours.

     Overall, the algorithm’s time complexity is O(n3 ), as this is the most dominant
factor in the algorithm.
     Comparing the complexities of the brute force method and our approach, we
observe a significant improvement in time complexity. The time complexity has been
reduced from O(n4 · 4n ) to O(n3 ).

      Morse theory is a powerful tool for studying the topology of spaces by analyzing
the critical points of real-valued functions defined on these spaces. It has been influen-
tial in the development of many areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology,
differential geometry, and mathematical physics. Furthermore, it has inspired the
development of discrete Morse theory, which extends the ideas of Morse theory to
discrete settings, such as cell complexes.
      Continuous Morse theory, first developed by Marston Morse in the 1920s and
1930s, establishes a relationship between the critical points of a smooth function (also
called a Morse function) on a manifold and the underlying topology of the manifold.
      The relationship between continuous and discrete Morse theory can be under-
stood as follows: In the discrete version, instead of utilizing a suitable class of contin-
uous functions on the spaces as Morse functions, a single numerical value is assigned
to each cell of the complex, rendering all associated processes discrete in nature. This
approach demonstrates that, even in the absence of continuity, it is possible to develop
a comprehensive theory within the realm of combinatorial spaces that captures many
of the complexities of the smooth theory. Moreover, this theory can be employed as an
effective tool for addressing a wide range of combinatorial and topological problems.
      In this chapter, we aim to provide a brief overview of continuous Morse theory,
followed by a more in-depth exploration of discrete Morse theory. We will draw
analogies between the continuous and discrete versions, highlighting the similarities
and differences between the two. Discrete Morse theory equips us with the required
tools to simplify and analyze simplicial complexes, making it particularly valuable

in the foundations of the Morse theory, the continuous Morse Theory section may
be skipped. However, it introduces CW complexes and attaching maps, which are
relevant to the discrete version. If familiar with these concepts, readers can focus on
discrete Morse theory, which is sufficient for understanding the research presented in
this work.


6.1      Continuous Morse Theory
In this section, we now describe the background of classical Morse theory that we hope
will provide a good foundation on which to begin studying the discrete analog. A
Morse function is a smooth real-valued function on a manifold such that all its critical
points (where the gradient is zero) are non-degenerate, meaning the Hessian matrix
(the matrix of second derivatives) is non-singular at these points. Morse theory is
based on the observation that the topology of a manifold can be described by the
behaviour of the Morse function in the vicinity of its critical points. Each critical
point is associated with an index, which is the number of negative eigenvalues of the
Hessian matrix at that point.
     In this section, we present theorems that enable us to construct a smooth mani-
fold using cell complexes. To fully comprehend this section, we first need to introduce
some definitions. For a more in-depth understanding, we recommend Milnor’s book
[6].
     A Morse function on a manifold is a smooth, real-valued function. A critical
point of a Morse function is a point in the domain of the function where the gradient
(the first derivative) vanishes. The function value at a critical point is called a critical
value. Non-degenerate critical points are critical points where the Hessian matrix (the
second derivative matrix) is non-singular (has a non-zero determinant) and degenerate
critical points are critical points where the Hessian matrix is singular (has a zero
determinant). The index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of
the Hessian matrix evaluated at the critical point.
     Throughout this section, f is a smooth real-valued function on a manifold M ,
and let M a be the set of all points x ∈ M such that f (x) ≤ a unless stated otherwise.
     We start by introducing an essential lemma in Morse theory called the Lemma
of Morse.
Lemma 6.1.1. [6] (Lemma of Morse.) Let p be a non-degenerate critical point for f .
Then, there is a local coordinate system (y1 , ..., yn ) in a neighbourhood U of p with
yi (p) = 0 for all i and such that the identity

                  f = f (p) − (y1 )2 − ... − (yλ )2 + (yλ+1 )2 + ... + (yn )2

holds throughout the neighbourhood U where λ is the index of p.
6. MORSE THEORY                                                                       108


    This lemma states that in a suitable local coordinate system, a Morse function
can be expressed as a quadratic form near a non-degenerate critical point.
    Now, we present a theorem that shows the relationship between two sublevel sets
when there are no critical values between their respective function values. Recall the
deformation retraction concept from Chapter 1 in Definitions 1.2.8 and 1.2.7.

Theorem 6.1.2. [6] Let a, b ∈ M and a < b and suppose that the set f −1 [a, b]
consisting of all p ∈ M with a ≤ f (p) ≤ b, is compact, and contains no critical points
of f . Then, M a is a deformation retract of M b , so that the inclusion map M a → M b
is a homotopy equivalence.

     This theorem implies that if there are no critical values between a and b, the
sublevel sets M a and M b have the same homotopy type.
     For the next theorems of this section, we need to familiarize ourselves with some
definitions.
     Let B d denote the closed unit ball in d-dimensional Euclidean space, defined
as B d = {x ∈ E d : |x| ≤ 1}. The boundary of B d is the unit (d − 1)-sphere
S (d−1) = {x ∈ E d : |x| = 1}.

Definition 6.1.3. A d-cell is a topological space homeomorphic to B d . For a d-
cell σ, we use ∂σ to represent the boundary of σ, the subset of σ corresponding to
S (d−1) ⊂ B d under any homeomorphism between B d and σ.
     The disjoint union of X and σ quotiented out by the equivalence relation where
each point s ∈ ∂σ is identified with f (s) ∈ X is denoted as X ∪f σ. Then X ∪f σ is
the result of attaching the cell σ to X, with f being the attaching map. Note that
the attaching map must be defined on the entire ∂σ.
     A finite CW complex is a topological space X for which there exists a finite
nested sequence X0 ⊂ X1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ X, where, for each i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, Xi is obtained
by attaching a cell to X(i−1) . Additionally, X0 is a 0-cell.

    In this text, we only work with finite CW complexes. It is a well-established yet
noteworthy fact that every simplicial complex can be regarded as a CW complex. For
more details on CW-complexes look at [5, Chapter 0].
    Next, we consider the case when there is a non-degenerate critical point with a
value between the function values of two sublevel sets.

Theorem 6.1.4. [6] Let p be a non-degenerate critical point with index λ. Setting
f (p) = c, suppose that f −1 [c − ϵ, c + ϵ] is compact, and contains no critical point of f
other than p, for some ϵ > 0. Then, for all sufficiently small ϵ, the set M c+ϵ has the
homotopy type of M c−ϵ with a λ−cell attached.

    This theorem reveals that when a non-degenerate critical point is present, it
contributes a λ-dimensional cell to the homotopy type of the manifold.
6. MORSE THEORY                                                                       109


    More generally suppose that there are k non-degenerate critical points pi , ..., pk
with indices λ1 , ..., λk in f −1 [c − ϵ, c + ϵ]. Then M c+ϵ has the homotopy type of M c−ϵ
with λ1 -cell, · · · , λk -cell attached.
    The next theorem demonstrates how the homotopy type of a manifold can be
represented as a CW-complex when f does not have any non-degenerate critical
points.

Theorem 6.1.5. [6] If f is a differentiable function on a manifold M with no degen-
erate critical points, and if each M a is compact, then M has the homotopy type of a
CW-complex, with one cell of dimension λ for each critical point of index λ.

      Example. If M is a compact manifold and f is a differentiable function on M
with only two critical points, both of which are non-degenerate, then M is homomor-
phic to a sphere.
      In this example, we see the application of the theorem to a specific case. This
illustrates the power of Morse theory in determining the topological structure of a
manifold based on the properties of the differentiable function defined on it.


6.2     Discrete Morse Theory
Discrete Morse theory, introduced by Robin Forman, is a combinatorial analog of clas-
sical Morse theory. Discrete Morse theory has been successfully applied in various
fields of applied mathematics and computer science, including topological data analy-
sis [12, 13], geometry [10], denoising [16], mesh compression [15] image processing and
computer graphics [14, 11], among others. It provides an efficient and elegant way to
study the topology of cell complexes, and it often leads to significant computational
advantages over traditional methods.
      In discrete Morse theory, a discrete Morse function is defined on the cells of a
cell complex. This function assigns a real number to each cell in the complex in such
a way that it satisfies certain conditions related to the boundaries of the cells. These
conditions ensure that the function behaves similarly to a classical Morse function on
a smooth manifold.
      The main idea behind discrete Morse theory is to pair cells using pairings of
cells that satisfy certain conditions with respect to the discrete Morse function. The
unpaired cells, or critical cells, provide a simplified description of the cell complex’s
topological structure, much like critical points in classical Morse theory provide a
simplified description of the topology of smooth manifolds.
      If we wish to know whether a given property holds for a certain topological space,
our question can often be reduced to the question of whether the space is equivalent
to another space for which the property holds.

6.2.1     Definitions
The main theorems of both discrete and continuous Morse theory are most effectively
conveyed through the framework of CW complexes, as previously defined in 6.1.3.
Utilizing discrete Morse theory, we can simplify a simplicial complex into a smaller
simplicial complex or a CW complex with fewer cells.
     In this section, we will consider X as an abstract simplicial complex, with α, β,
and γ representing simplices of X. Recall the concept of simplicial complexes from
Chapter 1 in subsection 1.1.
Definition 6.2.1. A simplex α is a face of simplex β, and β is a coface of α, if α ⊆ β.
Definition 6.2.2. For a simplex α with n vertices, we have dim(α) = n − 1 and
rank(α) = n.
      A simplex X with n vertices is denoted as an n-simplex. A face of α with
i vertices and a coface of α with j vertices are denoted as i-face and j-coface of α,
respectively. When α is a face of β we denote it by α ∈ β, and if dim(α) = dim(β)−1,
it is denoted by α ∈ ∂β.
Definition 6.2.3. [8] A DMF (discrete Morse function) f on a simplicial complex
X is a real-valued function on the set of simplices of X such that for each n-simplex
β both conditions 1 and 2 hold:
   1. At most one (n − 1)-face α of β has a value greater than or equal to that of β.
   2. At most one (n + 1)-coface γ of β has a value less than or equal to that of β.
     It is worth noting that under the conditions stipulated by Definition 6.2.3, it is
a logical impossibility for both conditions 1 and 2 to be satisfied simultaneously. The
proof substantiating this assertion can be found in [9, Lemma 2.5.].
Definition 6.2.4. [8] A critical n-simplex α of a discrete Morse function f on X is
a simplex for which:
   1. No (n − 1)-face α of β has a value greater than or equal to that of β.
   2. No (n + 1)-coface γ of β has a value less than or equal to that of β.
If α is a critical simplex, then f (α) is called a critical value of f .
Definition 6.2.5. For a ∈ R define the level subcomplex X a as
                                      ⋃︂        ⋃︂
                            Xa =                   α.
                                        β∈X,f (β)≤a   α≤β

That is, X a denotes all simplicies β such that f (β) ≤ a, as well as all of their faces.
In particular, X a is a subcomplex of X.
6. MORSE THEORY                                                                       111


    The next theorem is the analog of the Theorem 6.1.2 of the continuous Morse
theory.

Theorem 6.2.6. [8, Lemma 2.6.] If a < b are real numbers such that (a, b] contains
no critical values of f , then X b is homotopy equivalent to X a .

    The following theorem is the analog of the Theorem 6.1.4 of the continuous Morse
theory.

Theorem 6.2.7. [8, Lemma 2.7.] Suppose α is a critical simplex of dimension p with
f (α) ∈ (a, b] and f −1 ((a, b]) does not contain any other critical simplicies. Then there
is a map F : S (p−1) → X a such that X b is homotopy equivalent to X a ∪F B p .

      Let Xp (f ) (or simply Xp if it will not cause confusion) denote the number of
critical points of f of dimension p. The following is the result of the two last theorems.
This is the analog of the Theorem 6.1.5 in continuous Morse theory.

Corollary 6.2.8. [8, Theorem 2.5.] The simplicial complex X is homotopy equivalent
to a simplicial complex with exactly Xp (f ) simplicies of dimension p.

      In the context of discrete Morse theory, a pairing refers to a matching of cells (in
particular, simplices) of a complex such that each cell is either matched with one of
its faces or one of its cofaces. The pairing forms the basis for identifying critical cells
in the complex, which correspond to the unmatched cells in the pairing.

Definition 6.2.9. [8] Let f be a DMF on the simplicial complex X. The pairing P is
the set of all paired simplicies {α, β}; such that, α, β ∈ X, α ∈ ∂β, and f (α) ≥ f (β).

    The critical simplices as we have defined them above are exactly those that do
not appear in the pairing P .

6.2.2     Elementary Collapses
In the context of Discrete Morse Theory, the concept of ‘elementary collapses’ plays
a vital role in revealing the topological equivalences between different simplicial com-
plexes. Essentially, an elementary collapse is a simple operation that allows for the
reduction of a complex while preserving its homotopy type. This makes it a pow-
erful tool for topological simplification and computation, such as the calculation of
homology groups.
     In this section, we delve into the notion of elementary collapses, formally defining
the operation and exploring its implications. Central to our discussion is a lemma
which will be stated and proven. This lemma illuminates the process of dimension
reduction in a simplicial complex, utilizing the mechanism of elementary collapses.

Definition 6.2.10. [8] Let α, β be faces of X, with α ∈ ∂β. If α is not a face of any
other simplex β ′ ∈ X, then α is a free face of β.
Definition 6.2.11. [8] Let α be a free face of β. The deformation retract ∥ X ∥
\{int(α), int(β)} is called an elementary collapse, where ∥ X ∥ is the geometric real-
ization of the abstract simplicial complex X.
     When we perform an elementary collapse by removing the interiors of α and β, all
of their respective faces persist in the resulting space. This process can be perceived
as the removal of faces α and β from the abstract simplex X because what we are
actually eliminating are the sets of vertices that constitute the simplices α and β, not
their faces.
     For the sake of simplicity in our text, we will henceforth use the notation X to
represent the geometric realization of the simplicial complex X, when it is clear from
the context that we are referring to a topological space. Furthermore, X\α, β will
denote the result of an elementary collapse. In order to avoid the confusion between
removing an element of a set and collapsing, when we want to remove the element x
from X, we denote it by X − {x}.
     Since a deformation retraction is a special case of a homotopy equivalence, we
have the following:
Corollary 6.2.12. [8] If α is a free face of β, then X is homotopy equivalent to
X\{α, β} which is denoted by X ≃ X\{α, β}.
     The following lemma provides a way to simplify the study of homotopy properties
of simplicial complexes by replacing maximal simplices with simpler ones.
Lemma 6.2.13. Let C be an abstract simplicial complex and let X be one of its
maximal simplices of rank m. Suppose Y is an (m − 1)-face of X, and let y be the
vertex of X not included in Y . For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, define

                  Xi = {j-faces of X : 1 ≤ j ≤ i} − {i-faces of Y }.             (6.2.1)

If the largest intersection of X with another maximal simplex X ′ of C is the n-face
Z, where n < m, then X ≃ Xn+1 , and consequently

                   C ≃ C − {faces γ ∈ X : n + 1 < rank(γ) ≤ m}.                  (6.2.2)

    If X does not intersect any other maximal simplex of C, then it it homotopy
equivalent to a single point.
Proof:     Define Y ′ = {γ ⊆ X : y ∈ γ} as the set of all faces of X containing
the vertex y. It follows that X = Y ∪ Y ′ . From the definition of Xi we know
when i = m, Xm = X and when i = n + 1, Xn+1 = {j-faces of X : 1 ≤ j ≤
n + 1} − {(n + 1)-faces of Y }.
6. MORSE THEORY                                                                     113


      For 2 ≤ i ≤ m, let α be an (i − 1)-face of Y and β = α ∪ {y} be the unique
coface of α in X that contains y. Suppose the largest intersection of X with another
maximal simplex X ′ of C is the n-face Z.
      To demonstrate the homotopy equivalence X ≃ Xn+1 , we adopt a backwards
induction strategy, starting from m and proceeding downwards to n + 1. As part of
our inductive hypothesis, we propose that for all n+1 ≤ i ≤ m, α serves as a free face
of β. Given this hypothesis, we assert that the elementary collapse Xi \{α, β} is valid.
Our inductive step involves demonstrating the equality Xi \{α, β} = Xi+1 , which
consequently implies the homotopy equivalence Xi ≃ Xi+1 . By following the inductive
process through to its conclusion, we confirm the desired homotopy equivalence X ≃
Xn+1 .
      The base case of the induction is when i = m. In this case, α = Y and β = X.
Since n < m − 1, Y cannot be a face of any other maximal simplex of C, and thus,
the only coface of Y is X. This implies that Y is a free face of X. Hence, the
first collapse, i.e., Xm \{α, β} = Xm \{Y, X}, is valid. Also, since Y is the only
(m − 1)-face of Y , X is the only m-face of X, and Xm−1 = {j-faces of X : 1 ≤ j ≤
m − 1} − {(m − 1)-faces of Y }, we have Xm \{Y, X} = Xm−1 .
      As α is an (i−1)-face of Y for n+1 < i ≤ m, one of the cofaces of α, β = α∪{y},
is not included in Y but is included in Xi . Other cofaces of α belong to Y as they
do not include y. They are i-faces of Y and consequently do not belong to Xi by the
definition of Xi . Then β is the unique coface of α in Xi . Therefore, α is free in Xi .
      On the other hand, if i = n + 1, then α may have another coface in X ′ , so it
may not be a free face in Xn+1 . Therefore, we can only guarantee that α is a free
face in Xi for n + 1 < i ≤ m, and hence we can perform an elementary collapse on
the pair (α, β) in each such dimension. This implies that Xi ≃ Xi \ {α, β} for all
n + 1 < i ≤ m.
      To show that Xi ≃ Xi−1 for an n + 1 < i ≤ m, we will collapse all (i − 1)-faces α
of Y and their corresponding cofaces β = α ∪ {y} in Xi , and show that the resulting
simplicial complex is precisely Xi−1 as the following equality:
         Xi−1 = Xi \ {α, β} : α is an (i − 1)-face of Y, β = α ∪ {y} .            (6.2.3)
                       {︁                                             }︁

The following are the steps to prove the recent claim. The reasoning behind each
equation is given afterwards in detail.
   Xi−1 = {j-faces of X : 0 ≤ j ≤ i − 1} − {(i − 1)-faces of Y }
        = Xi − {i-faces of X and (i − 1)-faces of Y }
        = Xi − {i-faces of Y ′ and (i − 1)-faces of Y }
        = Xi − {α, β} : α is an (i − 1)-face of Y, β = α ∪ {y} is an i-face of Y ′
                {︁                                                                 }︁

        = Xi \ {α, β} : α is an (i − 1)-face of Y, β = α ∪ {y} .
               {︁                                               }︁

We can explain the reasoning behind each equality as follows:
6. MORSE THEORY                                                                   114


   • The first equality follows directly from Definition 6.2.1.

   • The second equality follows from the fact that Xi contains all j-faces of X for
     0 ≤ j ≤ i, except for the i-faces of Y . Thus, when we remove the i-faces of X
     and (i − 1)-faces of Y , we have Xi−1 .

   • The third equality follows from the fact that X = Y ∪ Y ′ , so the set of i-faces
     of X is the union of the set of i-faces of Y ′ and the set of i-faces of Y . Since
     the i-faces of Y were excluded from Xi , instead of removing i-faces of X in the
     second equality, we can be more precise and write i-faces of Y ′ .

   • The fourth equality follows from the fact that the set of (i − 1)-faces of Y
     coincides with the set of i-faces of Y ′ . For any such face α ∈ Y , there exists
     β = α ∪ {y}, which is an i-face of Y ′ ; and for any i-face β of Y ′ , there is an
     (i − 1)-face α = β − {y} in Y .

   • The fifth equality follows from the fact that removing a free face and its coface
     from an abstract simplicial complex is equivalent to collapsing them.

Therefore, we have shown that for n + 1 < i ≤ m, the elementary collapses Xi \ {α, β}
is valid, and hence, Xi ≃ Xi−1 . Consequently, we obtain that X ≃ Xn+1 by induction
on i from m to n + 1. This shows that the homotopy of the simplicial complex C
remains unchanged when we collapse its maximal simplex X to Xn+1 .
If X does not intersect any other simplex, then X ∩ X ′ = ∅ which is a 0-face, so n = 0
and X ≃ X1 . When i = 1, X1 is all the 1-faces (vertices) of X except the 1-faces of
Y . The only 1-face of X that is not included in Y is vertex y. Thus, X is homotopy
equivalent to a single point.




6.2.3    Homotopy Equivalence of n-Simplex to a Point
The theorem presented in this section, originally proved by Forman [8], will be re-
visited. While Forman used Hass diagrams in his proof, we will explore alternative
proof methods that align more closely with the focus of this work. Specifically, we
will offer two distinct proofs: one leveraging Lemma 6.2.13, and another utilizing the
properties of a discrete Morse function. These alternative viewpoints can provide
additional insight into the theorem and its applicability to our discussions.

Theorem 6.2.14. A n-simplex is homotopy equivalent to a point.

    In order to establish the validity of this theorem, we will employ two distinct
methods of proof:
6. MORSE THEORY                                                                      115


  1. Using Lemma 6.2.13 to perform elementary collapses on the n-simplex until it
     collapses to a point.
  2. Applying a DMF on the n-simplex and proving that it is a valid DMF with only
     one critical simplex which is a vertex.
Both approaches lead to the same conclusion, that an n-simplex is homotopy equiv-
alent to a single point.
Proof: (Using elementary collapses)
Let X be an abstract n-simplex. Then it is a simplicial complex consisting of just
one maximal simplex X. There is no intersection of maximal simplicies, therefore, by
Lemma 6.2.13, X is homotopy equivalent to a single point.


Proof: (Using a DMF)
We introduce a discrete Morse function (DMF) on an n-simplex, and demonstrate
that the only critical simplex in this setting is a vertex.
     Adhering to the notations established in Lemma 6.2.13, we let Y denote an
(n − 1)-face of X, and let y represent the vertex of X not present in Y . For a face
β ∈ X, we construct the function f accordingly:
                                     {︄
                                       rank(β)        y∈β
                             f (β) =
                                       rank(β) + 1 y ∈   /β

Now we check the validity of this DMF. Let α ⊂ β, then rank(α) < rank(β). Suppose
f (β) ≤ f (α). If y ∈ β ∩ α, or y ∈/ β ∪ α, then they do not satisfy f (β) ≤ f (α). The
only possibility is y ∈ β and y ∈ / α, then, f (β) = rank(β) and f (α) = rank(α) + 1,
and the following is true:
                        rank(β) ≤ rank(α) + 1 < rank(β) + 1.
Thus, rank(α) = rank(β) − 1 and α = β − {y}. Since y ∈ β, all the cofaces of β
contain y and have greater f -value than that of β. Since α = β − {y} is unique, f is
valid on X by definition of a DMF, in 6.2.3.
     In the case where y ∈ β, there will always exist a face α = β − {y} (given that β
possesses any faces) such that f (α) ≥ f (β). Conversely, when y ∈   / β, there will exist
a coface γ = β ∪ {y} such that f (β) ≥ f (γ).
     In light of this, none of the faces of X can be critical, with the exception of the
vertex y. The uniqueness of y lies in its dual identity: it is a face of X that includes
y and does not possess any other faces. By the Definition of a pairing in 6.2.9, we see
{β − {y}, β} are the simplex pairs of f except when β = {y}. Therefore, by applying
Corollary 6.2.8, we conclude that X is homotopy equivalent to y.

6.2.4     Dimension Reduction of Bedge P(33 )
The next proposition (︁ provides  a concrete example of how discrete Morse(︁ theory       )︁ can
be applied to Bedge P(33 ) . We introduce a function f on faces of Bedge P(33 ) and

show how it satisfies the conditions of a discrete Morse function.

Proposition 6.2.15. Let(︁ y be a)︁ vertex of the simplicial complex        Bedge    P(33 ) and
                                                                                 (︁       )︁

       f (β) =
                 rank(β) + 1 otherwise.

Proof:       If α ⊂ β, then rank(α) < rank(β). The only β and α that satisfy
                                                     / α, and α ⊈ Z ∩ Z ′ for any Z, Z ′ .
f (β) ≤ f (α) are those where β ⊈ Z ∩ Z ′ , y ∈ β, y ∈
Hence, we have f (α) = rank(α) + 1 and f (β) = rank(β). Then, we get

                          rank(β) ≤ rank(α) + 1 < rank(β) + 1

and thus rank(α) = rank(β) − 1. This implies that α is obtained from β by removing
the vertex y, i.e., α = β − {y}. Furthermore, since y ∈ β, any coface γ of β has a
strictly greater f -value than that of β.
Since α = β−{y} is unique, f is valid on X by definition of a DMF, in 6.2.3. Therefore,
the only pairs of this DMF are {β − {y}, β} where β ⊈ Z ∩ Z ′ , y ∈ β, β − {y} ⊈ Z ∩ Z ′
for any Z and Z ′ .
We know critical simplices γ of a given DMF as the simplices that do not appear in
a pair. We can further classify these critical simplices into three categories:

   1. γ : ∃(Z, Z ′ ), γ ⊆ Z ∩ Z ′ . This is because all the faces of γ are included in the
       {︁                        }︁

       intersection Z ∩ Z ′ and therefore have a smaller rank than γ.

   2. γ : ∀(Z, Z ′ ), γ ⊈ Z ∩ Z ′ ∧ (∃y ∈ γ) ∧ ∃(Z, Z ′ ) : γ − {y} ⊆ Z ∩ Z ′ . This
       {︁ (︁                        )︁            (︁                               )︁}︁

       is because f (γ) = rank(γ) and f (γ − {y}) = rank(γ) − 1, which means they
       cannot form a pair. Other faces of γ that include y also cannot form a pair with
       γ because their rank is smaller than γ.

   3. γ : (y ∈  / γ) ∧ ∀(Z, Z ′ ), γ ⊈ Z ∩ Z ′ ∧ (γ ∪ {y} is not a simplex) . This is
       {︁               (︁                     )︁                               }︁

       because f (γ) = rank(γ) + 1, and therefore the rank of all its faces are smaller
       than γ. Also, the only coface of γ that can form a pair with γ is γ ∪ {y} because
       f (γ ∪ {y}) = rank(γ) + 1. However, γ ∪ {y} is not a simplex, so γ is a critical
       simplex.

Moreover, in Table 4.6, we calculated the maximal intersection sizes of these simplices.

Hence, Bedge P(33 ) is homotopy equivalent to a sub-complex of itself with dimension

Proof: (Using a DMF)
Consider  an   arbitrary vertex   of B                  and let X be a maximal simplex of

      (︁    )︁

as we defined in Proposition 6.2.15. First, we determine which simplices of X are
critical.
     Let γ be a simplex of X.

   1. If rank(γ) = 13, then γ cannot be a critical simplex of(︁ the3 first type, because
      the rank of the largest intersecting simplices in Bedge P(3 ) is 12, hence γ is
                                                                     )︁

      not included in any intersection.

      If y ∈ γ, γ is not a critical simplex of the third type. The simplex γ − {y} has
      rank 12, so if it is included in an intersection (which is possible), γ is a critical
      simplex of the second type. If not, γ is not a critical simplex of the second type.
           / γ, γ cannot be a critical simplex of the second type. Furthermore, as
      If y ∈
      γ ∪{y} is a simplex (since γ is not a maximal simplex), γ is not a critical simplex
      of the third type.
      Hence, there exist critical simplices of rank 13 in X.

  2. If 14 ≤ rank(γ) < 36, γ cannot be a critical simplex of the first type, since it
     is not included in any intersection. If y ∈ γ, it is not a critical simplex of the
     second type, because γ − {y} has a rank of at least 13 and is not included in
     any intersection. As y ∈ γ, γ is not a critical simplex of the third type.
           / γ, γ is not a critical simplex of the second type. Since γ ∪ {y} is a simplex
      If y ∈
      (because γ is a sub-simplex of X), γ is not a critical simplex of the third type.

  3. If rank(γ) = 36 (i.e., γ = X), it can be readily confirmed that γ cannot be a
     critical simplex of any type.

    According to Definition 6.2.5, the subcomplex X 13 consists of all simplices β ⊆ X
such that f (β) = rank(β) ≤ 13. Since there are no critical simplices of rank greater
than 13 in X, Theorem 6.1.2 implies that X is homotopy        equivalent to X 13 .
    Next, consider a maximal simplex Z of Bedge P(33 ) that does not contain y
                                                      (︁     )︁

and is distinct from X. Since Z is not included in any intersection of other maximal
simplices, and because Z ∪ {y} is not a simplex (given Z is maximal), Z is a critical
simplex of the third type. Hence, this Morse function reduces the simplices containing
y to a 12-dimensional sub-complex of themselves while not affecting the maximal
simplices that do not contain y.
    In the final step, we select another vertex y ′ from a different maximal simplex
that has not been reduced yet, and apply the same process to reduce its(︁ dimension
to 12. Upon reducing(︁ the    dimensions of all maximal simplices   of)︁ Bedge P(33 ) , we
                                                                                     )︁

conclude that Bedge P(33 ) is homotopy      equivalent to Bedge P(33 ) 13 , which is a 12-

Conclusion and Future Work

                         — Marie Forleo, Everything Is Figureoutable




     In this thesis, we embarked on a comprehensive journey through the interplay of
graph theory and topology, all woven around the study of the chromatic number of
the partition graph P(33 ). Starting with Lovász’s work in 1978 [2], where topological
methods were deployed to deduce the chromatic number of the Kneser graph. This
led to the exploration of various topological lower bounds of the chromatic number
and their hierarchical arrangement, known as the Hierarchy theorem. Through this
study, we discovered both the strength and limitations of these lower bounds, thereby
highlighting their utility in certain scenarios and their divergence from the actual
chromatic number in others.
     One of our major achievements was the construction of the box complex Bedge (P(33 ))
of the partition graph P(33 ). Our understanding of the properties of this graph, and
our classification of its vertex pairs, triples, and quadruples, proved crucial in this
task. Moreover, our categorization of the maximal complete bipartite subgraphs was
pivotal in identifying all the maximal simplices of Bedge (P(33 )) and their antipodes,
leading to discovering the structure of the pairwise intersections of the simplices and
the size of the maximal intersections.
     In parallel with the theoretical developments, we also proposed an algorithm
to construct the box complex of P(33 ), which boasted a time complexity of O(n3 ), a
significant improvement over the O(n4 ·4n ) time complexity of a brute-force approach.
This result represented not just a theoretical advance, but a practical tool for handling
large graphs.

     Finally, to tame the complexity of the box complex of P(33 ), we used the frame-
work of discrete Morse theory. By allocating numerical values to each cell within
the complex, we fashioned a discrete Morse function. We were able to develop a
homotopy equivalent simplicial complex with reduced dimensionality in two ways:
via the application of the developed discrete Morse function, and through a series of
elementary collapses on the box complex. This reduction, from 35 to 12, significantly
simplified the future calculation of the Z2 -index and thus the Lovász bound. It also
provided a more manageable object for future analyses.
     Looking forward, the research outlined in this thesis paves the way for several
intriguing opportunities for future investigation. Our work in constructing the box
complex of the partition graph P(33 ) and significantly reducing its dimensionality
represents a substantial advancement in this area of study. Nonetheless, the com-
plex’s topological and combinatorial properties remain a fertile ground for further
exploration. One promising avenue for future research lies in the attempt to decrease
the dimension of the complex even further. By developing innovative strategies and
refining the techniques employed in this study, it may be possible to create a lower-
dimensionality representation of the box complex.
     While our findings confirm that certain regions of the box complex Bedge (P(33 ))
lack a Z2 -invariant S 4 with non-trivial homology, future research may yet uncover
such an S 4 within this box complex. Application of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem to
such a discovery would establish that χ(P(33 )) = 6 - a result previously affirmed
through exhaustive search, but which stands to be further substantiated through our
proposed approach.
     Furthermore, our study on the chromatic number of the partition graph P(33 )
could be expanded to consider different types of partition graphs. The analysis of
their chromatic numbers and the application of topological methods could yield new
insights into the interplay between graph theory and topology.
     Lastly, our algorithm to construct the box complex of P(33 ) could be generalized
to handle a wider class of graphs. Its performance in terms of time complexity could
be further optimized, and its implementation could be extended and refined.
     In summary, this thesis constitutes a step forward in our understanding of the
structure of the box complexes of the partition graph P(33 ), the lower bounds of the
chromatic number of this graph, and the role of topological methods in graph theory.
The journey is far from over, however, and we look forward to the advancements that
future research will bring.

Equivalencies of Vertex Triples

In Table 3.13, the classification of vertex triples into distinct equivalence classes based
on their types was summarised. Detailed proofs concerning the equivalence classes
of triples of type 5,5,5 were subsequently presented. The focus of this appendix will
be the detailed proof for the equivalence classes of the remaining triples types, which
might be of interest to some readers.

Lemma A.0.1. All triples of type 5,6,6 are equivalent.

Proof:
    In the light of Theorem 3.1.4, which shows that all vertex pairs of type 5 are
equivalent, consider a pair of vertices v and w of type 5.

                                                               123
               456 489
                                                                     4 56
               789 567
                                                                     89 7
                v   w

          Table A.1: The vertices v and w and their grid pattern of type 5

     The task is to identify all the possible third vertices u that are in a type-6
relationship with v and w, leading to non-equivalent v, w, u triples. The grid pattern
for the third vertex u must comply with the type-6 grid pattern in relation to v and
w:

                                    a1 a2   a3
                                    a4              a5 a6
                                            a7 a8   a9

               Table A.2: The grid pattern of u with v and u with w.


                                            121
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                 122


     where a1 , . . . , a9 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 9}.
     From the grid pattern of v and w in A.1, we observe that they share the cell
{1, 2, 3}, and the pairs {5, 6} and {8, 9}. From the grid pattern of u with v and u
with w in Table A.2, it is apparent that each cell of vertex u must share a pair with
a cell of v and a cell of w. These shared pairs can either be a common pair of v and
w or a non-shared pair of v and w.
     Assume a cell in u contains a common pair of v and w and an element from a
different common pair. For example, the cell {8, 9, 5}, where {8, 9} is a common pair
and 5 is from another common pair.
     This arrangement requires 6 and 7 to be in a different cell of u because of the
cell {5, 6, 7} in w. This could lead to a cell {6, 7, 4} in u, contradicting T(v, u) = 6
as {1, 2, 3} would become a common cell of v and u.
     Adding an element from {1, 2, 3} to {6, 7} in u results in a cell sharing no pairs
with any cell in v. Thus, u cannot feasibly contain a common pair and another
element from a different common pair.
     Next, we will explore potential arrangements of u by investigating possible place-
ments of the common pairs of v and w within u.
     Assume that u contains two common pairs of v and w, denoted as 5, 6 and 8, 9.
By this assumption, elements 7 and 4 cannot coexist within the same cell as these
pairs, as this would generate a common cell among u, v, and w. Therefore, they must
be collocated with an element from the set {1, 2, 3} in a cell like {1, 4, 7}. However,
this cell does not comply with the requirements, as it does not share two elements
with any cell from v and w. Consequently, u cannot feasibly contain both common
pairs of v and w, contradicting our initial assumption.
   • Suppose u does not share any common pairs of v and w with these vertices.
     Then the pairs can be placed in the cells of u in two ways.
        – Consider a situation where u shares two pairs, {5, 6} and {8, 9}, with
          vertices v and w. These pairs could potentially be arranged within u such
          that no two elements from the same pair coexist within a single cell:

                                  u = {{. . . }, {8, 6, .}, {5, 9, .}}.

           If no elements from the cell 1, 2, 3 are placed in conjunction with the pair
           elements, u is defined as:

                                u = {{1, 2, 3}, {8, 6, 4}, {5, 9, 7}}

           This configuration is problematic as the cell {1, 2, 3} becomes common
           among u, v, and w, invalidating u. Alternatively, if an element from
           {1, 2, 3} is placed alongside one of the pairs, for example:

                                u = {{4, 2, 3}, {8, 6, 1}, {5, 9, 7}}
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                     123


           the resulting cell {8, 6, 1} does not share any pair with any cell of v or w,
           invalidating u once more.
        – We can also consider a situation where u does not share any common pairs
          of v and w and the common pairs of v and w are distributed across three
          distinct cells of u:
                                  {{8, ., .}, {9, 5, .}, {6, ., .}}.
           If an element from {1, 2, 3}, for instance 1, is placed next to 9 and 5, then
           the resulting cell {9, 5, 1} does not share a pair with v or w. Alternatively,
           if one of either 4 or 7, say 7, is placed next to {9, 5}, and two elements
           from {1, 2, 3}, for example 1 and 2, are placed next to 8, then u is:

                                 u = {{1, 2, 8}, {9, 5, 7}, {6, 3, 4}}.

           In this case, the cell 6, 3, 4 does not share a pair with w, invalidating u.
   • Now suppose u shares a single common pair with v and w, and each element of
     the other pair is placed in a different cell, not cohabiting with the shared pair,
     such as:
                              u = {{8, ., .}, {5, 6, .}, {9, ., .}}.
      The element to be placed alongside 5 and 6 cannot be either 4 or 7, as this would
      create a common cell with either v or w. It must, therefore, be an element from
      1, 2, 3, say 3. If the elements 4 and 7 are placed in different cells alongside 8
      and 9, and two elements from 1, 2, 3, for instance 1 and 2, are in two different
      cells, then:
                               u = {{8, 4, 1}, {5, 6, 3}, {9, 7, 2}.}
      In this scenario, the cells 8, 4, 1 and 9, 7, 2 do not share a pair with v and w
      respectively, invalidating u. Consequently, the only feasible configuration for u
      is when 1 and 2 are in the same cell, and 4 and 7 are in the same cell:

                              u = {{8, 1, 2}, {5, 6, 3}, {9, 4, 7}}.

The cube pattern of this triple of type 5,6,6 is

The permutation that maps the corresponding units of two sets of triples of type 5,6,6
maps the vertices of the triple to each other. Hence, all the triples of type 5,6,6 are
equivalent.



Lemma A.0.2. All the triples of type 5,5,6 are equivalent.

Proof:
   Consider the vertices of type 6 with their cube pattern as follows:

               123 124                                              12 3

               789 567                                                 89 7
                v   w                               The grid pattern of v and w of type 6

                    Table A.4: An example of a type 6 vertex pair

     In constructing the third vertex u such that T(v, u) = 5 and T(w, u) = 5, it
is necessary to determine a common cell between v and u as well as a common cell
between w and u. In the case of v, every cell has an empty intersection with precisely
one cell of w. The common cell between v and u can be selected from any cell of v.
After determining this cell, denoted vα , the common cell between v and w will be the
one that does not intersect with vα . Subsequently, the remaining cell of u comprises
the elements of {1, 2, . . . , 9} that have not been included in the first two cells of u.
One possible configuration of u is when vα = {1, 2, 3}:

                           u = {{1, 2, 3}, {5, 6, 7}, {4, 8, 9}}.

The selection of a different cell from v does not alter the results of our analysis.
This is due to the consistent nature of the relationship between all cells of v and
w. Irrespective of which cell is selected from v, the interactions with the cells of w
follow the same patterns and principles, thus leading to consistent outcomes in the
formation of vertex u.
     The resulting cube of this triple follows a specific pattern. For each cell of v,
the cell consists of a union of elements from all units in the i-th row of all grids. For
each cell of w, it is a union of all elements from the units in the i-th column of the
following grids. Each cell of u is the union of all the elements of the units in each
respective grid:

     Permutations that map corresponding units of the cube pattern between two
triples of type 5,5,6 also facilitate mapping one triple to another.



Lemma A.0.3. All triples of type 6,6,6 are classified into two equivalence classes.
Proof:
     Consider the same pair v and w of type 6 as in Table A.4 in the previous propo-
sition.
     Given vertices v and w sharing triple pairs {1, 2}, {5, 6}, and {8, 9}, we investi-
gate possible configurations of a third vertex that upholds type-6 relationships with
both v and w. Each cell of the new vertex interacts with cells of v and w, sharing two
elements with one cell and one element with another. These interactions can occur
in two primary ways:
   • The intersection in question could comprise one of the common pairs of vertices
     v and w. Assume, without loss of generality, that {1, 2} forms the intersection
     between a cell of the new vertex u1 , {1, 2, 3} of v, and {1, 2, 4} of w. As such,
     elements 3 and 4 cannot be in a cell with the pair {1, 2} in u1 , resulting in two
     feasible scenarios:

        – The elements 3 and 4 are together in a cell of u1 :

                                 u1 = {{1, 2, .}, {3, 4, .}, {., ., .}}.

           Given that the cell {3, 4, .} in u1 must share two elements with a cell of v,
           and elements 1 and 2 from cell {1, 2, 3} of v have already been allocated
           to another cell in u1 , these elements cannot be employed to complete this
           cell. The only other option is to use the cell {4, 5, 6} of v. We can complete
           the cell {3, 4, .} as either {3, 4, 5} or {3, 4, 6}. However, neither of them
           shares a common pair with any cell of w, which contravenes the condition
           that T(w, u1 ) = 6. Therefore, elements 3 and 4 cannot share a cell in u1 .
        – The second scenario materializes when elements 3 and 4 are incorporated
          into distinct cells of u1 :

                                 u1 = {{1, 2, .}, {3, ., .}, {4, ., .}}.
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                   126


         Since {1, 2, 3} constitutes a cell of v and elements 1 and 2 are included in
         other cells of u1 , they cannot complete the cell {3, ., .} of u1 . Therefore,
         this cell mandates the inclusion of two elements from a cell of v. The pair
         {8, 9} is not viable, as this would yield {3, 8, 9}, a cell of w, creating a
         common cell between w and u1 . This conflicts with the type 6 constraint.
         Equally, neither the pair {7, 8} nor {7, 9} are permissible, as if {3, 7, 8} or
         {3, 7, 9} were to be a cell of u1 , then {4, 5, 6}, an existing cell of v, would
         emerge as the remaining cell of u1 , resulting in a common cell between v
         and u1 . This would contradict the type 6 constraint for vertices v and u1 .
         The only valid option is to form {3, 5, 6}:

                               u1 = {{1, 2, .}, {3, 5, 6}, {4, ., .}}.

         At this stage, the pairs {7, 8}, {7, 9}, and {8, 9} are the candidates from v
         to be co-located with 4. However, only the pair {8, 9} resides within the
         same cell of w, and the objective is for cell {4, ., .} to share a common pair
         with cells from both v and w. Consequently:

                              u1 = {{1, 2, 7}, {3, 5, 6}, {4, 8, 9}}.

    In observing the cube pattern for the triple v, w, u1 , it becomes apparent that
    all the common pairs of v and w exist across all vertices of this triple. In the
    ensuing cube pattern, the union of the i-th rows composes a cell of v, the union
    of the i-th columns constitutes a cell of w, and the union of all the units of the
    i-th grid forms a cell of u1 , with this holding true for i = 1, 2, 3:

             12                                 3
                                                    56                      4
                     7                                                          89

  6,6,6


  • Now assume the new vertex shares a pair of elements with v that is not a
    common pair of v and w, without loss of generality, consider {1, 3}. Then
    element 2 from cell {1, 2, 3} of v would then be placed in another cell of u2 ,
    yielding:
                            u2 = {{1, 3, .}, {2, ., .}, {., ., .}}.
    Inserting 5, 6, or 7 in the same cell as {1, 3} results in the absence of a shared
    pair with any cells of w. However, cells {1, 3, 8}, {1, 3, 9}, and {1, 3, 4} remain
    viable.
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                    127


        – Should {1, 3, 4} be a cell of u2 , element 2 must take a place next to a
          common pair of v and w so its cell would share a pair with a cell of v and
          a cell of w. It cannot occupy the same cell as either {5, 6} or {8, 9}. This
          condition would necessitate {7, 8, 9} or {5, 6, 7} to be a u2 cell, contravening
          the T(v, u2 ) = 6 and T(w, u2 ) = 6 conditions, respectively. As no pair can
          satisfactorily complete {2, ., .} of u2 , this scenario is infeasible.
        – Considering pair {8, 9} is shared between v and w, the cases where {1, 3, 8}
          or {1, 3, 9} form a u2 cell are functionally identical. Without loss of gen-
          erality, we assume

                                 u2 = {{1, 3, 8}, {2, ., .}, {., ., .}}.
          Here, the {7, 9} pair from v cell {7, 8, 9} cannot accompany element 2 in
          u2 as it would force {4, 5, 6} into being a shared cell between v and u2 ,
          a contradiction. Additionally, placing the pair {5, 6} in the same cell as
          element 2 results in a final u2 cell of 4, 7, 9, which does not share a pair
          with any w cell, another contradiction. The valid pairs shared between u2
          and v, that could accompany element 2, are {4, 5} and {4, 6}. Since {5, 6}
          is a shared pair of v and w, the two possible cases are equivalent. One
          feasible configuration would be:

                                u2 = {{1, 3, 8}, {2, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 9}}.

     Within the cube pattern of the triple v, w, u2 , it is notable that none of the
     common pairs shared by v and w are duplicated among this triple’s vertices. In
     the following cube pattern which presents the triple v, w, u2 , the union of the
     i-th rows corresponds to a v cell, the union of the i-th columns matches a w
     cell, and the union of all units within the i-th grid equates to a u2 cell.

    Table A.7: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u2 of the second kind of type
    6,6,6


      For two triples of the same kind within the type 6,6,6 category, we can modify
the cube pattern so that it adheres to the pattern as shown in Table A.7 or A.6. Con-
sequently, the permutation which aligns the corresponding units within their cubes
facilitates a mapping from one triple to another.

     from Table 4.4 we see the triples of the first kind of type 6,6,6 share 4 neighbours
and the triples of the second kind of type 6,6,6 share 1 neighbour. Therefore, the
triples from these two classes are not equivalent.



Lemma A.0.4. All the triples of type 5,5,7 are equivalent.

Proof:
   Consider a pair of type 7 with their grid pattern as the following:3.7:

               123 124                                               12 3

                    Table A.8: An example of a type-7 vertex pair

     To construct a new vertex u satisfying T(v, u) = 5 and T(w, u) = 5, it is necessary
to identify a common cell between v and u, as well as a common cell between w and
u. If either {4, 5, 6} from v or {3, 5, 7} from w were to serve as the common cell, each
would share one element with every cell of w or v respectively. This would counter
the precondition that T(w, u) = 5 and T(v, u) = 5. Consequently, neither of these
cells can be selected as the mutual cell.
     The cells {1, 2, 3} and {7, 8, 9} in v, along with the cells {1, 2, 4} and {6, 8, 9} in
w, are each distributed across two cells within w and v, respectively. Any of these
could potentially serve as the common cell between their respective vertices and u.
However, not all combinations will prove valid.
     Given that the cell {1, 2, 3} has empty intersection with the cell {6, 8, 9} of w,
they can be chosen as the common cells for u with v and w, respectively. Similarly,
the cells {7, 8, 9} of v and the cell {1, 2, 4} of w can be selected as common cells, as
they also have empty intersection. Without loss of generality, let {1, 2, 3} and {6, 8, 9}
be two cells of u.
     This leads to the remaining elements of {1, 2, . . . , 9} forming the final cell of u,
which is represented as follows:

                            u = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 7}, {6, 8, 9}}.

The cube pattern of v, w, u is the following, where each cell of v is the union of the
elements of units of the i-th rows of all grids, each cell of w is the union of all the
elements of the units of the i-th columns of all grids, and each cell of u is the union
of the elements of the units of the i-th grid with i = 1, 2, 3:

           Table A.9: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u of type 5,5,7

    The cube pattern of any triple of type 5,5,7 can be re-arranged so it follows the
pattern of this table. Then the permutation that maps the corresponding units to
each other, maps the vertices of one triple to the other triple’s vertices.



Lemma A.0.5. The vertex triples of type 6,6,7 are classified into two equivalence
classes.

Proof:
     For a given pair of vertices v and w of type 7 as denoted in Table A.8, a new
vertex u is constructed such that it satisfies T(v, u) = 6 and T(w, u) = 6. In this
context, each cell of u should share a pair of elements with a cell from both v and w.
The shared pairs of v and w can be arranged within the cells of u in three distinct
manners:

   • In the first scenario, where the mutual pairs {1, 2} and {8, 9} of v and w exist
     as separate pairs within two distinct cells of u, as expressed in:

                                 u = {{1, 2, .}, {8, 9, .}, {., ., .}}

     the only viable element that can be appended to both pairs is 5, as any other
     element would result in a shared cell between u and v or w, contradicting the
     conditions T(v, u) = 6 and T(w, u) = 6. Thus, this case is invalid.

   • For the second scenario, let u1 denote the new vertex. In this case, one of v
     and w’s common pairs occupies a single cell, while the other pair is distributed
     across two cells with one element paired with the other pair as shown:

                                u1 = {{1, 2, 9}, {8, ., .}, {., ., .}}.

     Given that cell {7, 8, 9} of v must share a pair with a cell in u1 and element 9
     already exists within a cell of u1 , it must share a pair with cell {8, ., .} of u1 . This
     cell has three possible formations that satisfy this condition, namely, {8, 7, 4},
     {8, 7, 5}, and {8, 7, 6}. The first option {8, 7, 4} is invalid as it intersects non-
     trivially with three cells from w. The second option {8, 7, 5} is also invalid as it
     necessitates the final cell of u1 to be {3, 4, 6}, which again results in non-trivial

      intersection with three cells of w. The only remaining valid configuration is
      {8, 7, 6}, hence we define the vertex u1 as follows:

                              u1 = {{1, 2, 9}, {8, 7, 6}, {3, 4, 5}}.

      The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u1 is:

               12                                                              3
                                                      6                      4 5
                        9                           7 8

          Table A.10: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u1 of type 6,6,7


   • In the final case, one of the two common pairs of v and w is included in a cell of
     the new vertex u2 , while the other pair’s elements are distributed in two different
     cells that are not shared with the other pair. We represent u2 as follows:

                               u2 = {{1, 2, .}, {8, ., .}, {9, ., .}}.

      Under these conditions, elements 6 and 7 cannot reside in the same cell. Suppose
      they were combined in a cell with 8; this would preclude all possible element
      choices to be placed next to 9. Therefore, u2 takes the form:

                               u2 = {{1, 2, .}, {8, 7, .}, {9, 6, .}}

      and the only option for the rest of the elements is

                              u2 = {{1, 2, 5}, {8, 7, 3}, {9, 6, 4}}.

      The following is the cube pattern is the triple v, w, u2 :

               12                                   3
                    5                                                        4      6
                                                    7 8                             9

          Table A.11: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u2 of type 6,6,7


Since the way the common pairs of v and w are arranged in the cells of u1 and u2 ,
these two triples are not equivalent. Therefore, all the triples of type 6,6,7 are classi-
fied into two classes each following the cube pattern of one of the patterns introduced
here.
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                     131


Lemma A.0.6. The vertices of type 5,6,7 are of two equivalence classes.
Proof:
     Given the vertices v and w of type 5 (referenced in Table A.1), we aim to construct
a new vertex u satisfying T(v, u) = 7 and T(w, u) = 6. This requires u to share three
element pairs with w and two element pairs with v. Further, there must exist a cell
in u sharing one element with each cell of v.
     Denote this cell as c1 . Considering the cube pattern of v and w, c1 must share
an element pair with a cell of w. The construction of c1 necessitates an element
from {1, 2, 3} and an isolated element from column i combined with an element from
the corresponding element pair in the same column for i = 2, 3. Therefore, we can
arbitrarily assign c1 = {1, 4, 8} without loss of generality.
     Given that element 1 is part of cell c1 in u, elements 2 and 3 must be assigned
to another cell in u. Denote this cell as c2 . We cannot include 9 in c2 , as this would
result in {5, 6, 7} becoming a shared cell of u and w, which is contradictory to our
original conditions. The remaining choices for the third element of c2 are 5, 6, or 7.
However, as {5, 6} forms a common pair of v and w, the choice of 5 or 6 would not
materially alter the configuration of u up to equivalence. Consequently, u could be
any of the following:

                          u1 = {{1, 4, 8}, {2, 3, 5}, {6, 7, 9}}
                          u2 = {1, 4, 8}, {2, 3, 9}, {5, 6, 7}.

So, the vertices of two equivalence classes are of the following cube patterns:

                1                             23
                    4                                   5                       6
                    8                                                         9 7

          Table A.13: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u2 of type 5,6,7

     Given that the common pairs of vertices v and w are positioned differently within
the cells of u1 and u2 , it follows that u1 and u2 are not equivalent.
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                     132


Lemma A.0.7. The vertex triples of type 6,7,7 are classified into six equivalence
classes.

Proof:
     Given the vertices v and w of type 6, as outlined in Table A.4, we aim to construct
a new vertex, u, which exhibits a type 7 relationship with both v and w. The cells
of u either intersect with all cells of v and w, or only intersect with two of their cells.
Accordingly, these cells follow certain configurations, which are as follows:

   • Let c1 denote a cell in u that intersects non-trivially with all cells in both v and
     w. This cell cannot contain any common pairs of v and w, as this would negate
     its property of intersecting with all cells of v and w. By referencing the grid
     pattern of v and w, we can determine there are two non-equivalent possibilities
     for the configuration of c1 :

        – One feasible configuration for c1 is to include one element from each com-
          mon pair of v and w, for instance {1, 5, 8}. Consequently, the subsequent
          cell, c2 , must incorporate a pair from both v and w. Reviewing the grid
          pattern of v and w reveals that the only viable selections for c2 are {2, 3, 4}
          or {6, 7, 9}. The adoption of one of these pairs for c2 necessitates the use
          of the remaining option for the final cell of u. Let u1 denote the vertex u
          under these circumstances:

                                 u1 = {{1, 5, 8}, {2, 3, 4}, {6, 7, 9}}.

           The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u1 is:

          common pairs of v and w, then c1 = {3, 4, 7}. The subsequent cell of u,
          denoted as c2 , must share a pair of elements with a cell of v and another
          pair with a cell of w. Given the grid pattern of v and w, it is clear that
          c2 must include a common pair of v and w, in addition to a single element
          from another common pair, leading to c2 = {1, 2, 5}. Let u2 represent the
          vertex u in this case, which leads to:

                                 u2 = {{3, 4, 7}, {1, 2, 5}, {6, 8, 9}}.

   If we now assume that c1 intersects non-trivially with three cells of v and only
   two cells of w, it requires three elements from the three rows of the cube pattern
   of v and w and from two columns, therefore no common pair of v and w can
   exist in c1 . There are three non-equivalent possibilities for c1 :

     – When c1 = {1, 4, 7}, it includes two elements that are not part of v and w’s
       common pairs and one element that is. In this scenario, let c2 be the cell of
       u that intersects non-trivially with three cells of w and only two cells of v.
       The only possible configuration for c2 in this case would be c2 = {2, 3, 5}.
       Let u3 denote the vertex u under these conditions, yielding:

Given that the arrangement of the common pair elements of v and w across the cells
of ui , with i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 6}, are dissimilar, it can be inferred that the triples v, w, ui
are inequivalent. Subsequent observations made in Table 4.4, where it is noted that
some of these triples share differing numbers of common neighbours, further reinforce
the assertion of their non-equivalence.



Lemma A.0.8. The vertex triples of type 7,7,7 are categorized into five equivalent
classes.

Proof:
     Let vertices v and w be of type 7, as outlined in Table A.8, and let u be the third
vertex which holds a type 7 relation with both v and w. We will denote the first cell
of u as c1 . The plausible arrangements for this cell are:

   • In one case, c1 shares an element with each cell of v. This cell cannot encom-
     pass a common pair of v and w because it would not maintain a non-empty
     intersection with each cell of v. Instead, it can include one element from each
     of the common pairs, namely {1, 2} and {8, 9}; for instance, c1 = {1, 8, .}. Let
     s = {3, 7, 4, 6} designate a set where each element is part of a cell in either v or
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                               135


   w and coexists with a common pair of v and w, according to the grid pattern of
   v and w. Hence, each element in s can be considered equivalent in this context,
   whereas the element 5 is distinct. Thus, c1 could incorporate an element from
   set s or the element 5, leading to the two non-equivalent configurations for c1 ,
   namely c1 = {1, 8, 4} or c1 = {1, 8, 5} which are analyzed in the following:

     – Let c1 = {1, 8, 4} and allow c2 to represent the cell of u which shares a
       single element with each cell of w. Consequently, it must also share two
       elements with a cell of v. In this configuration, the elements of c2 can take
       one of the two following arrangements:
          ∗ Let c2 include an element from each of the common pairs of v and w, in
            addition to an element from set s. As an example, and representative
            of other equivalent cases, we could have c2 = {2, 9, 7}. Including the
            element 5 within c2 is not a feasible option due to {2, 9, 5} sharing an
            element with each cell of v. Under these conditions, we will denote this
            particular configuration of u as u1 . Therefore, this vertex is arranged
            as follows:
                               u1 = {{1, 8, 4}, {2, 9, 7}, {3, 5, 6}}.
            The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u1 is:

             1                             2                               3
             4                                                             5 6

       Table A.20: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u1 of type 7,7,7

          ∗ Let c2 include one element from the common pairs and two elements
            from set s. Thus, we have c2 = {2, 3, 6} as a feasible configuration. If
            u2 represents u under this circumstance, then we have:

                               u2 = {{1, 8, 4}, {2, 3, 6}, {5, 7, 9}}

                   8                                                       7 9

           ∗ Alternatively, c2 can take one element from s and the element 5, re-
             sulting in c2 = {2, 5, 6}. If u3 represents u under this arrangement, we
             derive the following vertex configurations:

                                 u3 = {1, 8, 4}, {2, 5, 6}, {3, 7, 9}}

             with the cube pattern of v, w, u3 as follows:

              1                              2                               3
              4                                  5 6

         Table A.22: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u3 of type 7,7,7

      – For the case where c1 = {1, 8, 5}, the cell c1 intersects with each cell of
        both v and w. Therefore, cell c2 must share two elements with one cell
        of v, two elements with one cell of w, one element with another cell of v,
        and one element with another cell of w. By utilizing the grid pattern of v
        and w, it is clear that the only feasible construction for c2 is to select one
        element from a common pair and two elements from the set s from two
        rows and two columns. For instance, let c2 = {9, 4, 6}. We will represent
        u in this case as u4 . The vertex then becomes:

                              u4 = {{1, 8, 5}, {4, 6, 9}, {2, 3, 7}}.

         The corresponding cube pattern for v, w, u4 is as follows:

             1                                                            2 3
                  5                          4      6
                      8                             9                        7

         Table A.23: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u4 of type 7,7,7

  • When none of the elements in c1 are sourced from the common pairs of v and w,
    two of its elements must necessarily be 3 and 7. Given that {3, 5, 7} constitutes
    a cell of w, 5 cannot be the third element of c1 . As such, the third element of
    c1 must be an element from the set s. As an example, consider c1 = {3, 7, 4}.
    Now, let c2 share a single element with each cell of w. Given that {3, 5, 7} is a
    cell of w and elements 3 and 7 are already included in cell c1 , element 5 must be
    included in c2 , alongside two other elements - each originating from a distinct
    cell of w. From the cell {1, 2, 3} of w, c1 can incorporate an element from the
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                    137


      common pair {1, 2}. Meanwhile, from the cell {6, 8, 9}, it can only incorporate
      6. If it incorporates either 8 or 9, c2 will end up sharing one element with each
      cell of v, but we already know in this instance that c2 intersects with only two
      cells of v. Therefore, c2 = {5, 1, 6}.
      Represent the vertex u in this scenario as u5 . As such, the configuration is:

                              u5 = {{3, 7, 4}, {5, 1, 6}, {2, 8, 9}}.

      The corresponding cube pattern for the triple v, w, u5 will be as follows: v, w, u5 :

                   3                           1                              2
               4       5                           5 6
                   7                                                                89

          Table A.24: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u5 of type 7,7,7


Thus, every vertex triple of type 7,7,7 is equivalent to one of the triples v, w, ui where
i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. These triples are not equivalent due to the varying placement of
the common element pairs between vertices v and w within the cube patterns of the
third vertex u. As shown in Table 4.4, the count of shared neighbors for some of these
triples differs, further substantiating their non-equivalence.



Lemma A.0.9. The vertex triples of type 5,7,7 are classified into five equivalence
classes.

Proof:
     Let v and w represent the vertices of type 5 as detailed in Table A.1. We aim
to construct a third vertex, u, such that T(v, u) = T(w, u) = 7. Denote the first cell
of u as c1 and assume it shares a single element with each cell of v. The potential
scenarios for this cell are:

   • One component of c1 is taken from the cell {1, 2, 3}. The remaining two elements
     of c1 originate from two distinct common pairs of v and w. An equivalent
     possibility for c1 is {1, 5, 8}, as it shares one element with each cell of v and w.
     Consequently, the remaining cells of u share two elements with a cell of v and
     one element with another cell of v, and the situation is analogous for w.
      Let s = {4, 7}. The elements of s are interchangeable, as they are the sole
      elements that sit alongside the common pairs of v and w in the cells of these
      vertices. The following scenarios are feasible for the cell c2 of u:
A. EQUIVALENCIES OF VERTEX TRIPLES                                                  138


      – The cell c2 includes two elements, each from a distinct common pair of v
        and w, and a single element from the set s. For instance, c2 = {9, 6, 7}. If
        u is denoted as u1 in this case, it can be represented as:
                              u1 = {{1, 5, 8}, {9, 6, 7}, {2, 3, 4}}.
         The corresponding cube pattern for v, w, u1 is then:

             1                                                           23

        Table A.25: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u1 of type 5,7,7

      – If the cell c2 takes two elements from the cell {1, 2, 3} and one element
        from the set s, it leads to an equivalent vertex to u1 .
      – The cell c2 takes two elements from the set {1, 2, 3} and one element from
        a common pair of v and w. For instance, c2 = {2, 3, 6}. If u2 represents u
        in this case, it is expressed as:
                              u2 = {{1, 5, 8}, {2, 3, 6}, {4, 7, 9}}.
         The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u2 is subsequently:

             1                               23

        Table A.26: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u2 of type 5,7,7

  • The cell c1 contains one element from the common pairs, one element from the
    set {1, 2, 3}, and one element from the set s. A potential combination for c1
    could be {1, 4, 8}. It intersects with each cell of v at exactly one point and
    shares two elements with a cell of w.
    For the cell c2 , it intersects with each cell of w at one point and shares two
    elements with a cell of v. Given that {4, 8, 9} is a cell of w and the elements 4
    and 8 are included in c1 , the cell u2 must contain 9. Furthermore, it requires an
    element from {1, 2, 3}. Consequently, the last element of c2 has to be 7, yielding
    c2 = {9, 7, 2}.
    Denoting this representation of u as u3 , we can express it as:

    The cube pattern for the vertex triple v, w, u3 is subsequently:

              1                             2                             3
                  4                                                                56
                  8                              9 7

        Table A.27: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u3 of type 5,7,7

  • If c1 takes on the elements 1, 4, and 7, it shares a single element with each
    cell of both v and w. As a result, the remaining cells of u each intersect with
    two elements of a cell from v, and a single element of another cell from v. The
    same pattern holds true with respect to w. For c2 , we identify two potential,
    non-equivalent arrangements:
      – In the scenario where c2 draws one element from {1, 2, 3} and two elements
        from a common pair of v and w, one possibility for this cell is c2 = {2, 5, 6}.
        We will denote u as u4 in this case. Under this configuration, u4 would be:
                             u4 = {{1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 6}, {3, 8, 9}}.
         Consequently, the cube pattern for v, w, u4 appears as follows:

             1                              2                             3
                  4                                  56
                      7                                                       89

        Table A.28: The cube pattern of the triple v, w, u4 of type 5,7,7

      – For another feasible configuration of c2 , two elements can be selected from
        {1, 2, 3} along with a single element from a common pair of v and w.
        Consider the example c2 = {2, 3, 9}. In this circumstance, represent u as
        u5 . Consequently, u5 is structured as follows:
                             u5 = {{1, 4, 7}, {2, 3, 9}, {5, 6, 8}}.
         As a result, the cube pattern for the v, w, u5 triple emerges as follows:

             1                              23
                  4                                                                56
                      7                          9                            8

     Considering the distinct arrangement of elements pertaining to the common cell
and common pairs of vertices v and w within the cells of u, it is clear that the triples
v, w, ui for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are not equivalent. As a result, vertex triples of type
5,7,7 are categorised into five distinct equivalence classes. As evidenced in Table 4.4,
triples from certain different classes share varying quantities of common neighbours.
Appendix B

Inclusion of Vertex Quadruples

The analysis that follows will produce the results depicted in the final column of Table
4.5. We fix the type of the triple, u, v, w, in each of the subsequent bullet points and
investigate the possible scenarios for the fourth vertex, p. Consequently, we ascertain
the maximal complete bipartite subgraph which results from applying the method
outlined in Remark 4.1.1 to the quadruple.

   • The triple u, v, w is of type 5,5,5:
     We recall Table 4.4 where we demonstrated that triples of type 5,5,5 can be
     classified into two classes, namely the first kind and the second kind. Also, we
     observed that triples of the first kind share 6 neighbours, while triples of the
     second kind have no common neighbours.
     Assuming that the triple u, v, w belongs to the second kind of 5,5,5, it follows
     that the vertices of the quadruple do not share any neighbours because the
     vertices of the triple do not have any common neighbours.
     Consider a triple of the first kind of type 5,5,5 as follows:

                                     123      123    123
                                     456      489    468
                                                                                  (B.1)
                                     789      756    579
                                       v        w      u

     From the same table, we observe that the maximal complete bipartite subgraph
     derived from this triple by the method outlined in Remark 4.1.1 is a K4,6 :
                         (︂ (︁                         )︂
                                                                               (B.2)
                                          )︁
                           CN CN(v, w, u) , CN(v, w, u) = K4,6 .

     For this triple of type 5,5,5 we study the cases number 5 and 6 of Table 4.5:


                                            141
B. INCLUSION OF VERTEX QUADRUPLES                                                    142


      3. The four triples of the quadruple v, w, u, p are of type 5,5,5. If one of them
         is of the second kind, then the quadruple does not share any neighbours.
         Suppose all of them are of the first kind. Since all the pairs of this quadru-
         ple are of type 5, by Lemma 4.1.9, the common cell of p with the rest of
         the vertices of the quadruple is {1, 2, 3}. Our objective is to identify a
         possible fourth vertex in a way that every triple of the quadruple is of the
         first kind of type 5,5,5. To accomplish this, each element from the pairs of
         common elements shared by the vertex pairs v, w and v, u and w, u should
         be allocated to distinct cells within vertex p. The common pairs of v, w
         are {5, 6} and {8, 9}. Then,

                               p = {{1, 2, 3}, {5, 8, .}, {6, 9, .} or              (B.3)
                               p = {{1, 2, 3}, {5, 9, .}, {6, 8, .}}.               (B.4)

         Also, one of the common pairs of w, u and v, u is {5, 7} and {7, 9} respec-
         tively, which means 7 cannot be in the same cell with 5 and 9. It is not
         possible unless 5 and 9 are in the same cell. Thus, the vertex p in (B.3) is
         not a valid candidate. Using p in (B.4), we have:

                               p = {{1, 2, 3}, {5, 9, 4}, {6, 8, 7}}.               (B.5)

         In Figure 4.9, we have listed all the common neighbours of vertices v, w,
         and u. Upon examining the adjacency relations of these common neigh-
         bours with vertex p, it is evident that p shares an edge with each of these
         common neighbours. Therefore, {v, w, u, p} ⊆ CN(CN(v, w, u)). Similar
         to previous cases, the maximal complete bipartite subgraph derived from
         the quadruple v, w, u, p is equal to the K4,6 in equation B.2:
                        (︂ (︁                )︁              )︂
                          CN CN(v, w, u, p) , CN(v, w, u, p) = K4,6 .

      4. Since the triple p, w, u is of type 5,5,5, all the vertices of this triple share
         a cell which is {1, 2, 3}. However, if p has the cell {1, 2, 3}, it cannot be in
         type 7 with v. As a result, it can be concluded that a quadruple with the
         pair types as outlined in case number 6 does not exist.

  • The triple v, w, u is of type 6,6,6:
    If any triple within the quadruple v, w, u, p falls into the equivalence class of type
    6,6,6 that does not share any neighbours (refer to Table 4.4), the quadruple can
    either have one common neighbour or none. This scenario results in a K1,36 or
    it may not form a complete bipartite subgraph.
B. INCLUSION OF VERTEX QUADRUPLES                                                  143


   Let the following triple v, w, u belong to the equivalence class of vertices of type
   6,6,6 that share four neighbours.

                                       123 124 127
                                       456 389 356
                                                                                  (B.6)
                                       789 567 489
                                         v   w   u

   As observed in Table 4.4, the maximal complete bipartite subgraph that can be
   constructed from this triple, using the method outlined in Remark 4.1.1, forms
   a K6,4 :           (︂ (︁                           )︂
                                         )︁
                        CN CN(v, w, u) , CN(v, w, u) = K6,4
   The common neighbours of this triple coincide with the common neighbours of
   the vertex pair v, w, as previously illustrated in Figure 4.4.
   Now we study cases number 7 and 8 of Table 4.5:

     5. Since p is in a type 5 relationship with v, w, and u, it necessitates a
        common cell with each. There are three possible cells to choose from in v
        as the common cell of v and p. It is known that each cell of v has an empty
        intersection with exactly one cell of w and one cell of u. Upon choosing one
        cell of v, these respective cells of w and u are designated as the common
        cells with p. Consequently, p could represent any of the following vertices,
        namely p, r, and t:
                                        123 124 127
                                        489 356 389
                                        567 789 456
                                          p     r    t
        It can be readily confirmed that the vertices p, r, and t are adjacent to all
        the common neighbours of v, w, and u depicted in Figure 4.4. As a re-
        sult, we can ascertain that {v, w, u, p, r, t} ⊆ CN(CN(v, w, u)). Analogous
        to previous cases, we can conclude that the maximal complete bipartite
        subgraph derived from the quadruple v, w, u, p corresponds to a K6,4 :
                        (︁                                     )︁
                             CN(CN(v, w, u, p)), CN(v, w, u, p) = K6,4 .
     6. Each triple of the quadruple v, w, u, p is of type 6,6,6. We will assume all
        triples belong to the class of triples of type 6,6,6 that share four neighbours,
        as the alternative would result in the quadruple sharing only one common
        neighbour or none at all. Referring to the cube pattern in Table A.6,
        we observe that each triple’s vertices share three pairs of elements from
B. INCLUSION OF VERTEX QUADRUPLES                                                    144


          {1, 2, . . . , 9}. For the triple v, w, u in (B.6), the shared pairs are {1, 2},
          {5, 6}, and {8, 9}. Therefore, p must also share these same pairs, indicating
          that p must have the form p = {{1, 2, .}, {5, 6, .}, {8, 9, .}}.
          However, there is no valid placement for elements 3, 4, and 7 as they are in
          the same cell with a shared pair in each vertex of the triple v, w, u. Placing
          3 in one of the empty spots in p would result in a shared cell with a vertex
          of the triple v, w, u. The same issue arises for elements 4 and 7.
          Therefore, we conclude that there is no vertex that can be in a type 6
          relationship with v, w, and u.
  • The triple v, w, u is of type 5, 5, 7:
    Consider the following vertex triple of this type:
                                       123 124 123
                                       456 357 689
                                                                                    (B.7)
                                       789 689 457
                                         v   w   u
    The common neighbours of these vertices can be identified in the same manner
    as was done for vertices v and w in the diagram provided in Figure 4.6. As per
    Table 4.4, the complete bipartite subgraph constructed from such a triple yields
    a K4,4 :            (︂ (︁                         )︂
                                                                              (B.8)
                                         )︁
                          CN CN(v, w, u) , CN(v, w, u) = K4,4 .
    Now we examine case number 9 of Table 4.5:
      7. In this scenario, all triples are of type 5,5,7 relationship. Given that
         T(p, v) = T(p, w) = 5, vertex p must share one cell with v and one with
         w. However, the common cell with w cannot be {6, 8, 9} and the common
         cell with v cannot be {1, 2, 3}, as these would conflict with T(p, u) = 7.
         Also, the common cell of p and v cannot be {4, 5, 6} as it contradicts
         T(p, w) = 5, and the common cell of p and w cannot be {3, 5, 7} as this
         contradicts with T(p, v) = 5. Hence, the only viable option for p is the
         following configuration:
                                 p = {{1, 2, 4}, {3, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}.
          It can be easily verified that this vertex is adjacent to all the common
          neighbours of the triple v, w, u depicted in Figure 4.6. Consequently,
          {v, w, u, p} ⊆ CN(CN(v, w, u)). Similar to previous cases we deduce:
                          (︂ (︁              )︁               )︂
                            CN CN(v, w, u, p) , CN(v, w, u, p) = K4,4 .
