### Overview 

This GitHub repository showcases a word cloud generated from my MSc thesis titled "Topological Approaches to Chromatic Number and Box Complex Analysis of Partition Graphs." The word cloud visualizes the frequency of terms used in the thesis.

### About the Project
In this project, I utilized the [WordCloud package](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/index.html) to create a visual representation of the key terms and concepts present in my MSc thesis. The choice of a word cloud allows viewers to quickly grasp the most prominent topics within the thesis.

### Inspiration
I drew inspiration from a [colleague's thesis word cloud project](https://github.com/alexmcsw/Thesis-Word-Cloud), which motivated me to explore creative ways of presenting academic content.


### Cloud Mask
I created a custom mask for the word cloud to reflect the shape of a famous object introduced in my thesis, the edge box complex:
